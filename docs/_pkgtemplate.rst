A description of the package (`astropy.packagename`)
====================================================

Introduction
------------

Include general content that might be useful for understanding the
package here, as well as general scientific or mathematical background
that might be necessary for the "big-picture" of this package.


Getting Started
---------------

Short tutorial-like examples of how to do common-tasks - should be
fairly quick, with any more detailed examples in the next section.


Using `packagename`
-------------------

.. THIS SECTION SHOULD BE EITHER


This section is for the detailed documentation.  For simpler packages, this
should either by paragraphs or sub-divided into sub-sections like:

Sub-topic 1
^^^^^^^^^^^

Content if needed

A Complex example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Content if needed


.. OR IF MORE COMPLICATED,

For more complicated packages that require multiple documents, this
should just be a table of contents referencing those documents:

.. toctree::
    packagename/subdoc1
    packagename/subdoc2
    packagename/subdoc3


Either a toctree or sub-sections should be used, *not* both. If you
decide to use a multi-file/toctree approach, the main file (the one based
on this template) should live in that directory as ``index.rst``.

For example, if your toctree looks like the above example, you should
move this document to ``docs/packagename/index.rst``, and the other
documents should be ``docs/packagename/subdoc1.rst``,
``docs/packagename/subdoc2.rst``, and ``docs/packagename/subdoc3.rst``.

-------------------

Include here any references to related packages, articles, or texts.
