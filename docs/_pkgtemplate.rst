A description of the package (`astropy.packagename`)
====================================================

Introduction
------------

Include general content that might be useful for understanding the package here,
as well as general scientific or mathematical background that might be necessary
for the "big-picture" of this package.


Getting Started
---------------

Short tutorial-like examples of how to do common-tasks - should be fairly quick,
with any more detailed examples in the next section.


Using packagename
-----------------

This section is for the detailed documentation.  For simpler packages, this
should either by paragraphs or sub-divided into sub-sections like:

Sub-topic 1
^^^^^^^^^^^

Content if needed

A Complex example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Content if needed



For more complicated packages that require multiple documents, this should just
be a table of contents referencing those documents:

.. toctree::
    packagename/subdoc1
    packagename/subdoc2
    packagename/subdoc3


Either a toctree or sub-sections should be used, *not* both.


See Also (optional)
-------------------

Include here any references to related packages, articles, or texts.


Reference/API
-------------

.. automodapi:: packagename


Acknowledgments and Licenses (optional)
---------------------------------------

Any acknowledgements or licenses needed for this package - remove the section if
none are necessary.
