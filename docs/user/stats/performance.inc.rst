Performance Tips
================

If you are finding sigma clipping to be slow, and if you have not already done
so, consider installing the `bottleneck <https://pypi.org/project/Bottleneck/>`_
package, which will speed up some of the internal computations. In addition, if
you are using standard functions for ``cenfunc`` and/or ``stdfunc``, make sure
you specify these as strings rather than passing a NumPy function â€” that is,
use::

    >>> sigma_clip(array, cenfunc='median')  # doctest: +SKIP

instead of::

    >>> sigma_clip(array, cenfunc=np.nanmedian)  # doctest: +SKIP

Using strings will allow the sigma-clipping algorithm to pick the fastest
implementation available for finding the median.
