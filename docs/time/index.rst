Time and Dates (`astropy.time`)
****************************************************

Introduction
============

The `astropy.time` package provides functionality for manipulating times and
dates.  Specific emphasis is placed on supporting time scales (e.g. UTC, TAI, UT1) and
time representations (e.g. JD, MJD, ISO 8601) that are used in astronomy.
It uses Cython to wrap the C language `ERFA`_ time and calendar
routines.  All time scale conversions are done by Cython vectorized versions
of the `ERFA`_ routines and are fast and memory efficient.

All time manipulations and arithmetic operations are done internally using two
64-bit floats to represent time.  Floating point algorithms from [#]_ are used so
that the |Time| object maintains sub-nanosecond precision over times spanning
the age of the universe.

Getting Started
===============

The basic way to use `astropy.time` is to create a |Time|
object by supplying one or more input time values as well as the `time format`_ and
`time scale`_ of those values.  The input time(s) can either be a single scalar like
`"2010-01-01 00:00:00"` or a list or a `numpy` array of values as shown below.
In general any output values have the same shape (scalar or array) as the input.

  >>> from astropy.time import Time

  >>> times = ['1999-01-01 00:00:00.123456789', '2010-01-01 00:00:00']
  >>> t = Time(times, format='iso', scale='utc')
  >>> t
  <Time object: scale='utc' format='iso' value=['1999-01-01 00:00:00.123' '2010-01-01 00:00:00.000']>
  >>> t[1]
  <Time object: scale='utc' format='iso' value=2010-01-01 00:00:00.000>

The ``format`` argument specifies how to interpret the input values, e.g. ISO
or JD or Unix time.  The ``scale`` argument specifies the `time scale`_ for the
values, e.g. UTC or TT or UT1.

Now let's get the representation of these times in the JD and MJD
formats by requesting the corresponding |Time| attributes::

  >>> t.jd
  array([ 2451179.50000143,  2455197.5       ])
  >>> t.mjd
  array([ 51179.00000143,  55197.        ])

We can also convert to a different time scale, for instance from UTC to
TT.  This uses the same attribute mechanism as above but now returns a new
|Time| object::

  >>> t2 = t.tt
  >>> t2
  <Time object: scale='tt' format='iso' value=['1999-01-01 00:01:04.307' '2010-01-01 00:01:06.184']>
  >>> t2.jd
  array([ 2451179.5007443 ,  2455197.50076602])

Note that both the ISO and JD representations of ``t2`` are different than for
``t`` because they are expressed relative to the TT time scale.


Using `astropy.time`
=====================

Time object basics
-------------------

In `astropy.time` a "time" is a single instant of time which is
independent of the way the time is represented (the "format") and the time
"scale" which specifies the offset and scaling relation of the unit of time.
There is no distinction made between a "date" and a "time" since both concepts
(as loosely defined in common usage) are just different representations of a
moment in time.

Once a |Time| object is created it cannot be altered internally.  In code lingo
it is "immutable."  In particular the common operation of "converting" to a
different `time scale`_ is always performed by returning a copy of the original
|Time| object which has been converted to the new time scale.


.. _time-format:

Time Format
^^^^^^^^^^^

The time format specifies how an instant of time is represented.  The currently
available formats are can be found in the ``Time.FORMATS`` dict and
are listed in the table below.  Each of these formats is implemented as a class
that derives from the base :class:`~astropy.time.core.TimeFormat` class.
This class structure can be easily adapted and extended by users for
specialized time formats not supplied in `astropy.time`.

=========  ====================================================
Format            Class
=========  ====================================================
byear      :class:`~astropy.time.core.TimeBesselianEpoch`
byear_str  :class:`~astropy.time.core.TimeBesselianEpochString`
cxcsec     :class:`~astropy.time.core.TimeCxcSec`
datetime   :class:`~astropy.time.core.TimeDatetime`
gps        :class:`~astropy.time.core.TimeGPS`
iso        :class:`~astropy.time.core.TimeISO`
isot       :class:`~astropy.time.core.TimeISOT`
jd         :class:`~astropy.time.core.TimeJD`
jyear      :class:`~astropy.time.core.TimeJulianEpoch`
jyear_str  :class:`~astropy.time.core.TimeJulianEpochString`
mjd        :class:`~astropy.time.core.TimeMJD`
plot_date  :class:`~astropy.time.core.TimePlotDate`
unix       :class:`~astropy.time.core.TimeUnix`
yday       :class:`~astropy.time.core.TimeYearDayTime`
=========  ====================================================

Subformat
""""""""""

The time format classes :class:`~astropy.time.core.TimeISO`,
:class:`~astropy.time.core.TimeISO`, and
:class:`~astropy.time.core.TimeYearDayTime` support the concept of
subformats.  This allows for variations on the basic theme of a format in both
the input string parsing and the output.

The supported subformats are ``date_hms``, ``date_hm``, and ``date``.  The
table below illustrates these subformats for `iso` and `yday` formats:

=========  ========== ===========================
Format     Subformat  Input / output
=========  ========== ===========================
``iso``    date_hms   2001-01-02 03:04:05.678
``iso``    date_hm    2001-01-02 03:04
``iso``    date       2001-01-02
``yday``   date_hms   2001:032:03:04:05.678
``yday``   date_hm    2001:032:03:04
``yday``   date       2001:032
=========  ========== ===========================


.. _time-scale:

Time Scale
^^^^^^^^^^

The time scale (or `time standard
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_standard>`_) is "a specification for
measuring time: either the rate at which time passes; or points in time; or
both" [#]_. See also [#]_ and [#]_.
::

  >>> Time.SCALES
  ('tai', 'tcb', 'tcg', 'tdb', 'tt', 'ut1', 'utc')

The system of transformation between supported time scales is shown in the
figure below.  Further details are provided in the `Convert time scale`_ section.

.. image:: time_scale_conversion.png

Scalar or Array
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A |Time| object can hold either a single time value or an array of time values.
The distinction is made entirely by the form of the input time(s).  If a |Time|
object holds a single value then any format outputs will be a single scalar
value, and likewise for arrays.  Like other arrays and lists, |Time| objects
holding arrays are subscriptable, returning scalar or array objects as
appropriate::

  >>> from astropy.time import Time
  >>> t = Time(100.0, format='mjd', scale='utc')
  >>> t.jd
  2400100.5
  >>> t = Time([100.0, 200.0, 300.], format='mjd', scale='utc')
  >>> t.jd
  array([ 2400100.5,  2400200.5,  2400300.5])
  >>> t[:2]
  <Time object: scale='utc' format='mjd' value=[ 100.  200.]>
  >>> t[2]
  <Time object: scale='utc' format='mjd' value=300.0>

Inferring input format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The |Time| class initializer will not accept ambiguous inputs,
but it will make automatic inferences in cases where the inputs are
unambiguous.  This can apply when the times are supplied as `~datetime.datetime`
objects or strings.  In the latter case
it is not required to specify the format because the available
string formats have no overlap.  However, if the format is known in advance
the string parsing will be faster if the format is provided.
::

  >>> from datetime import datetime
  >>> t = Time(datetime(2010, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3), scale='utc')
  >>> t.format
  'datetime'
  >>> t = Time('2010-01-02 01:02:03', scale='utc')
  >>> t.format
  'iso'

Internal representation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The |Time| object maintains an internal representation of time as a pair of
double precision numbers expressing Julian days. The sum of the two numbers is
the Julian Date for that time relative to the given `time scale`_.  Users
requiring no better than microsecond precision over human time scales (~100
years) can safely ignore the internal representation details and skip this section.

This representation is driven by the underlying ERFA C-library implementation.
The ERFA routines take care throughout to maintain overall precision of the
double pair.  The user is free to choose the way in which total JD is
distributed between the two values.

The internal JD pair is available via the ``jd1`` and ``jd2`` attributes.
Notice in the example below that when converting from UTC to TAI, the
small offset is placed in the ``jd2`` value thus maintaining the highest
numeric precision::

  >>> t = Time('2010-01-01 00:00:00', scale='utc')
  >>> t.jd1, t.jd2
  (2455197.5, 0.0)
  >>> t2 = t.tai
  >>> t2.jd1. t2.jd2
  (2455197.5, 0.0003935185185185185)

Creating a Time object
----------------------

The allowed |Time| arguments to create a time object are listed below:

**val** : numpy ndarray, list, str, or number
    Data to initialize table.
**val2** : numpy ndarray, list, str, or number; optional
    Data to initialize table.
**format** : str, optional
    Format of input value(s)
**scale** : str, optional
    Time scale of input value(s)
**precision** : int between 0 and 9 inclusive
    Decimal precision when outputting seconds as floating point
**in_subfmt** : str
    Unix glob to select subformats for parsing string input times
**out_subfmt** : str
    Unix glob to select subformats for outputting string times
**lat** : float, optional
    Earth latitude of observer
**lon** : float, optional
    Earth longitude of observer

val
^^^

The `val` argument is the only argument that is always required when creating a
|Time| object.  This argument specifies the input time or times and
can be a single string or number, or it can be a Python list or `numpy` array
of strings or numbers.

The `val` argument  specifies the input time or times and
can be a single string or number, or it can be a Python list or `numpy` array
of strings or numbers. To initialize a |Time| object based on a specified time,
it *must* be present.  If `val` is absent (or `None`), the |Time| object will
be created for the time corresponding to the instant the object is created.

In most situations one also needs to specify the `time scale`_ via the
`scale` argument.  The |Time| class will never guess the `time scale`_,
so a simple example would be::

  >>> t1 = Time(50100.0, scale='tt', format='mjd')
  >>> t2 = Time('2010-01-01 00:00:00', scale='utc')

It is possible to create a new |Time| object from one or more existing time
objects.  In this case the format and scale will be inferred from the
first object unless explicitly specified.
::

  >>> Time([t1, t2])
  <Time object: scale='tt' format='mjd' value=[ 50100.  55197.00076602]>

val2
^^^^

The `val2` argument is available for specialized situations where extremely
high precision is required.  Recall that the internal representation of time
within `astropy.time` is two double-precision numbers that when summed give
the Julian date.  If provided the `val2` argument is used in combination with
`val` to set the second the internal time values.  The exact interpretation of
`val2` is determined by the input format class.  As of this release all
string-valued formats ignore `val2` and all numeric inputs effectively add
the two values in a way that maintains the highest precision.  Example::

  >>> t = Time(100.0, 0.000001, format='mjd', scale='tt')
  >>> t.jd, t.jd1, t.jd2
  (2400100.500001, 2400100.5, 1e-06)

format
^^^^^^

The `format` argument sets the time `time format`_, and as mentioned it is
required unless the format can be unambiguously determined from the input times.


scale
^^^^^

The `scale` argument sets the `time scale`_ and is required except for time
formats such as ``plot_date`` (:class:`~astropy.time.core.TimePlotDate`) and ``unix``
(:class:`~astropy.time.core.TimeUnix`).  These formats represent the duration
in SI seconds since a fixed instant in time which is independent of time scale.

precision
^^^^^^^^^^

The `precision` setting affects string formats when outputting a value that
includes seconds.  It must be an integer between 0 and 9.  There is no effect
when inputting time values from strings.  The default precision is 3.  Note
that the limit of 9 digits is driven by the way that ERFA handles fractional
seconds.  In practice this should should not be an issue.  ::

  >>> t = Time('B1950.0', scale='utc', precision=3)
  >>> t.byear_str
  'B1950.000'
  >>> t.precision = 0
  >>> t.byear_str
  'B1950'

in_subfmt
^^^^^^^^^

The `in_subfmt` argument provides a mechanism to select one or more
`subformat`_ values from the available subformats for string input.  Multiple
allowed subformats can be selected using Unix-style wildcard characters, in
particular ``*`` and ``?``, as documented in the Python `fnmatch
<http://docs.python.org/library/fnmatch.html>`_ module.

The default value for `in_subfmt` is ``*`` which matches any available
subformat.  This allows for convenient input of values with unknown or
heterogeneous subformat::

  >>> Time(['2000:001', '2000:002:03:04', '2001:003:04:05:06.789'], scale='utc')
  <Time object: scale='utc' format='yday'
   value=['2000:001:00:00:00.000' '2000:002:03:04:00.000' '2001:003:04:05:06.789']>

One can explicitly specify `in_subfmt` in order to strictly require a
certain subformat::

  >>> t = Time('2000:002:03:04', scale='utc', in_subfmt='date_hm')
  >>> t = Time('2000:002', scale='utc', in_subfmt='date_hm')
  ERROR: ValueError: Input values did not match any of format classes
  ['iso', 'isot', 'yday']

out_subfmt
^^^^^^^^^^

The `out_subfmt` argument is similar to `in_subfmt` except that it applies
to output formatting.  In the case of multiple matching subformats the first
matching subformat is used.

  >>> Time('2000-01-01 02:03:04', scale='utc', out_subfmt='date').iso
  '2000-01-01'
  >>> Time('2000-01-01 02:03:04', scale='utc', out_subfmt='date_hms').iso
  '2000-01-01 02:03:04.000'
  >>> Time('2000-01-01 02:03:04', scale='utc', out_subfmt='date*').iso
  '2000-01-01 02:03:04.000'

lat and lon
^^^^^^^^^^^^

These optional parameters specify the observer latitude and longitude in
decimal degrees.  They default to 0.0 and are used for time scales that are
sensitive to observer position.  Currently the only time scale for which this
applies is TDB, which relies on the ERFA routine ``eraDtdb`` to determine the
time offset between TDB and TT.

Getting the Current Time
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The current time can be determined as a `Time` object using the
`~astropy.time.Time.now` class method::

  >>> nt = Time.now()
  >>> ut = Time(datetime.utcnow(), scale='utc')

The two should be very close to each other.




Using Time objects
-------------------

There are three basic operations available with |Time| objects:

- Get the representation of the time value(s) in a particular `time format`_.
- Get a new time object for the same time value(s) but referenced to a different
  `time scale`_.
- Do time arithmetic involving |Time| and/or |TimeDelta| objects.

Get representation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Instants of time can be represented in different ways, for instance as an
ISO-format date string (``'1999-07-23 04:31:00'``) or seconds since 1998.0
(``49091460.0``) or Modified Julian Date (``51382.187451574``).

The representation of a |Time| object in a particular format is available
by getting the object attribute corresponding to the format name.  The list of
available format names is in the `time format`_ section.

  >>> t = Time('2010-01-01 00:00:00', format='iso', scale='utc')
  >>> t.jd        # JD representation of time in current scale (UTC)
  2455197.5
  >>> t.iso       # ISO representation of time in current scale (UTC)
  '2010-01-01 00:00:00.000'
  >>> t.unix      # seconds since 1970.0 (UTC)
  1262304000.0
  >>> t.plot_date # Date value for plotting with matplotlib plot_date()
  733773.0003935185
  >>> t.datetime  # Representation as datetime.datetime object
  datetime.datetime(2010, 1, 1, 0, 0)

Example::

  >>> import matplotlib.pyplt as plt
  >>> jyear = np.linspace(2000, 2001, 20)
  >>> t = Time(jyear, format='jyear', scale='utc')
  >>> plt.plot_date(t.plot_date, jyear)
  >>> plt.gcf().autofmt_xdate()  # orient date labels at a slant
  >>> plt.draw()

Convert time scale
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A new |Time| object for the same time value(s) but referenced to a new `time
scale`_ can be created getting the object attribute corresponding to the time
scale name.  The list of available time scale names is in the `time scale`_
section and in the figure below illustrating the network of time scale
transformations.

.. image:: time_scale_conversion.png

Examples::

  >>> t = Time('2010-01-01 00:00:00', format='iso', scale='utc')
  >>> t.tt        # TT scale
  <Time object: scale='tt' format='iso' value=2010-01-01 00:01:06.184>
  >>> t.tai
  <Time object: scale='tai' format='iso' value=2010-01-01 00:00:34.000>

In this process the ``format`` and other object attributes like ``lat``,
``lon``, and ``precision`` are also propagated to the new object.


As noted in the `Time object basics` section, a |Time| object is immutable and
the internal time values cannot be altered once the object is created.  The
process of changing the time scale therefore begins by making a copy of the
original object and then converting the internal time values in the copy to the
new time scale.  The new |Time| object is returned by the attribute access.

Transformation offsets
""""""""""""""""""""""

Time scale transformations that cross one of the orange circles in the image
above require an additional offset time value that is model or
observation-dependent.  See `SOFA Time Scale and Calendar Tools
<http://www.iausofa.org/2012_0301_C/sofa/sofa_ts_c.pdf>`_ for further details.

The two attributes :attr:`~astropy.time.Time.delta_ut1_utc` and
:attr:`~astropy.time.Time.delta_tdb_tt` provide a way to set
these offset times explicitly.  These represent the time scale offsets
UT1 - UTC and TDB - TT, respectively.  As an example::

  >>> t = Time('2010-01-01 00:00:00', format='iso', scale='utc')
  >>> t.delta_ut1_utc = 0.334  # Explicitly set one part of the transformation
  >>> t.ut1.iso    # ISO representation of time in UT1 scale
 '2010-01-01 00:00:00.334'

For the UT1 to UTC offset, one has to interpolate in observed values provided
by the `International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service
<http://www.iers.org>`_.  By default, `astropy` is shipped with the final
values provided in Bulletin B, which cover the period from 1962 to shortly
before an astropy release, and these will be used to compute the offset if the
:attr:`~astropy.time.Time.delta_ut1_utc` attribute is not set explicitly.  For
more recent times, one can download an updated version of `IERS B
<http://hpiers.obspm.fr/iers/eop/eopc04/eopc04_IAU2000.62-now>`_ or `IERS A
<http://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/finals2000A.all>`_ (which also has
predictions), and set :attr:`~astropy.time.Time.delta_ut1_utc` as described in
`~astropy.time.Time.get_delta_ut1_utc`::

  >>> from astropy.time.iers import IERS_A, IERS_A_URL
  >>> from astropy.utils.data import download_file
  >>> iers_a_file = download_file(IERS_A_URL, cache=True))  # doctest: +SKIP
  >>> iers_a = IERS_A.open(iers_a_file)                     # doctest: +SKIP
  >>> t.delta_ut1_utc = t.get_delta_ut1_utc(iers_a)         # doctest: +SKIP

In the case of the TDB to TT offset, most users need only provide the ``lat``
and ``lon`` values when creating the |Time| object.  If the
:attr:`~astropy.time.Time.delta_tdb_tt` attribute is not explicitly set then
the ERFA C-library routine ``eraDtdb`` will be used to compute the TDB to TT
offset.  Note that ``lat`` and ``lon`` are initialized to 0.0 by default, so
those defaults will be used if they are not provided.

The following code replicates an example in the `SOFA Time Scale and Calendar
Tools <http://www.iausofa.org/2012_0301_C/sofa/sofa_ts_c.pdf>`_ document.  It
does the transform from UTC to all supported time scales (TAI, TCB, TCG, TDB,
TT, UT1, UTC).  This requires auxilliary information (latitude and longitude).
::

  >>> lat = 19.48125
  >>> lon = -155.933222
  >>> t = Time('2006-01-15 21:24:37.5', format='iso', scale='utc',
  ...          lat=lat, lon=lon, precision=6)
  >>> t.utc.iso
  '2006-01-15 21:24:37.500000'
  >>> t.ut1.iso
  '2006-01-15 21:24:37.834078'
  >>> t.tai.iso
  '2006-01-15 21:25:10.500000'
  >>> t.tt.iso
  '2006-01-15 21:25:42.684000'
  >>> t.tcg.iso
  '2006-01-15 21:25:43.322690'
  >>> t.tdb.iso
  '2006-01-15 21:25:42.683799'
  >>> t.tcb.iso
  '2006-01-15 21:25:56.893378'

Time Deltas
-----------

Simple time arithmetic is supported using via the |TimeDelta| class.  The
following operations are available:

- Create a TimeDelta explicitly by instantiating a class object
- Create a TimeDelta by subtracting two Times
- Add a TimeDelta to a Time object to get a new Time
- Subtract a TimeDelta from a Time object to get a new Time
- Add two TimeDelta objects to get a new TimeDelta
- Negate a TimeDelta or take its absolute value
- Multiply or divide a TimeDelta by a constant or array

.. note::
    As implemented, the arithmetic is not guaranteed to be good beyond
    float64, as round-off errors are not yet properly carried between the
    two values representing the date.  Like for ERFA, taking the first
    value as (half-)integer helps, as this can be represented exactly
    by a float64 (at least for all but multiply and divide).

The |TimeDelta| class is derived from the |Time| class and shares many of its
properties.  The key difference is that the time scale is always TAI so that
all time deltas are referenced to a uniform Julian Day which is exactly 86400
standard SI seconds.

The available time formats are:

=========  ===================================================
Format            Class
=========  ===================================================
sec        :class:`~astropy.time.core.TimeDeltaSec`
jd         :class:`~astropy.time.core.TimeDeltaJD`
=========  ===================================================

Examples
^^^^^^^^^

Use of the |TimeDelta| object is easily illustrated in the few examples below::

  >>> t1 = Time('2010-01-01 00:00:00', scale='utc')
  >>> t2 = Time('2010-02-01 00:00:00', scale='utc')
  >>> dt = t2 - t1  # Difference between two Times
  >>> dt
  <TimeDelta object: scale='tai' format='jd' value=31.0>
  >>> dt.sec
  2678400.0

  >>> from astropy.time import TimeDelta
  >>> dt2 = TimeDelta(50.0, format='sec')
  >>> t3 = t2 + dt2  # Add a TimeDelta to a Time
  >>> t3.iso
  '2010-02-01 00:00:50.000'

  >>> t2 - dt2  # Subtract a TimeDelta from a Time
  <Time object: scale='utc' format='iso' value=2010-01-31 23:59:10.000>

  >>> dt + dt2
  <TimeDelta object: scale='tai' format='jd' value=31.0005787037>

  >>> t1 + dt * np.linspace(0, 1, 5)
  <Time object: scale='utc' format='iso' value=['2010-01-01 00:00:00.000'
  '2010-01-08 18:00:00.000' '2010-01-16 12:00:00.000' '2010-01-24 06:00:00.000'
  '2010-02-01 00:00:00.000']>
