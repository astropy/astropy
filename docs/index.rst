sign up for the `astropy mailing list <http://mail.scipy.org/mailman/listinfo/astropy>`_.
Alternatively, the `astropy-dev
<http://groups.google.com/group/astropy-dev>`_ list is where you should go to

Reporting issues
***********************

If you have come across something that you believe is a bug, please open a
ticket in the Astropy `issue tracker
<http://github.com/astropy/astropy/issues>`_, and we will look into it
promptly.

Please try to include an example that demonstrates the issue and will allow the
developers to reproduce and fix the problem.  If you are seeing a crash
then frequently it will help to include the full Python stack trace as well as
