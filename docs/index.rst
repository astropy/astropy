The ``astropy`` package contains key functionality and common tools needed for
performing astronomy and astrophysics with Python.  It is at the core of the
`Astropy Project <http://www.astropy.org/about.html>`_, which aims to enable
the community to develop a robust ecosystem of `affiliated packages`_
covering a broad range of needs for astronomical research, data
processing, and data analysis.

.. Important:: If you use Astropy for work presented in a publication or talk
   please help the project via proper `citation or acknowledgement
   <https://www.astropy.org/acknowledging.html>`_.  This also applies to use of
   software or `affiliated packages`_ that depend on the astropy
   core package.
