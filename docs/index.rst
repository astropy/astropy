Welcome to Astropy's Documentation!
===================================

Astropy is a community-driven package intended to contain much of the core functionality and some common tools needed for performing astronomy and astrophysics with Python.

While no releases have yet occured, development is occuring at the `project's github page
<http://github.com/astropy/astropy>`_.

For discussions and ideas regarding development of the Astropy package, see the `astropy-dev mailing list <http://groups.google.com/group/astropy-dev>`_. For broader discussion on python in astronomy and updates/general discussion on the Astropy project, there is also an `astropy mailing list <http://mail.scipy.org/mailman/listinfo/astropy>`_.
