Getting help
***********************

If you want to get help or discuss issues with other Astropy users, you can
sign up for the `astropy mailing list <http://mail.scipy.org/mailman/listinfo/astropy>`_.
Alternatively, the `astropy-dev
<http://groups.google.com/group/astropy-dev>`_ list is where you should go to
discuss more technical aspects of Astropy with the developers.

***********************
Reporting issues
***********************

If you have come across something that you believe is a bug, please open a
ticket in the Astropy `issue tracker
<http://github.com/astropy/astropy/issues>`_, and we will look into it
promptly.

Please try to include an example that demonstrates the issue and will allow the
developers to reproduce and fix the problem.  If you are seeing a crash
then frequently it will help to include the full Python stack trace as well as
information about your operating system (e.g. MacOSX version or Linux version).
