The ``astropy`` package contains key functionality and common tools needed for
performing astronomy and astrophysics with Python.  It is at the core of the
`Astropy Project <http://www.astropy.org/about.html>`_, which aims to enable
the community to develop a robust ecosystem of `Affiliated Packages
<http://www.astropy.org/affiliated/index.html>`_ covering a broad range of
needs for astronomical research, data processing, and data analysis.

.. Important:: If you use Astropy for work presented in a publication or talk
   please help the project via proper `citation or acknowledgement
   <http://www.astropy.org/acknowledging.html>`_.  This also applies to use of
   software or `affliated packages <http://www.astropy.org/affiliated/>`_ that
   depend on the astropy core package.
