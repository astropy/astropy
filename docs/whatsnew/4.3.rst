What's New in Astropy 4.3?
**************************

Overview
========

Astropy 4.3 is a major release that ...  since
the 4.2.x series of releases.

In particular, this release includes:

* :ref:`whatsnew-4.3-threadsafe`
* :ref:`whatsnew-4.3-sigma-clipping`
*

In addition to these major changes, Astropy v4.3 includes a large number of
smaller improvements and bug fixes, which are described in the
:ref:`changelog`. By the numbers:

* xxx issues have been closed since v4.2
* xxx pull requests have been merged since v4.2
* xxx distinct people have contributed code

.. _whatsnew-4.3-coordinates:

Transformations to AltAz are now much more precise (and faster)
===============================================================

Following advice from M. K. Brewer and comparisons with accurate verification
samples, the implementations for the transformations to AltAz coordinates were
made much more precise (down to the milli-arcsec level).  To help this, the
``CIRS`` frame has gained an observer ``location`` attribute.

Furthermore, by ensuring expensive calculations of the precession-nutation
matrix are only done once, the transformations have been sped up considerably.

.. _whatsnew-4.3-threadsafe:

Improvements in making Astropy thread-safe
==========================================

To help use of Astropy in multi-threaded environments (e.g., with Dask), an
effort has been started to make the basic infrastructure of ``astropy``
thread-safe for operations that do not explicitly change state. In particular,
parsing of units and angles, and initializing leap-second tables should now be
safe even when done simultaneously in multiple threads, as should any use of
the `~astropy.utils.decorators.lazyproperty` decorator (and the ``lazy=True``
version of `~astropy.utils.decorators.classproperty`).

.. _whatsnew-4.3-sigma-clipping:

Performance improvements to sigma clipping
==========================================

The performance of the sigma clipping functions in the :ref:`stats` module has
now been signficantly improved when more than a couple of iterations are
required and the built-in functions for determining the central values and
standard deviations are used. The performance gains are especially noticeable
when using the ``axis`` keyword and different parts of the array being sigma
clipped require different numbers of iterations. In these cases the performance
can be 10-20x better or more.
