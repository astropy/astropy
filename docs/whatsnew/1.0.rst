What's New in Astropy 1.0?
==========================

Overview
--------


About Long-term support
-----------------------

Astropy v1.0 is a long-term support (LTS) release.  This means v1.0 will
be supported with bug fixes for 2 years from its release, rather than 6
months like the non-LTS releases. More details about this, including a
wider rationale for Astropy's version numbering scheme, can be found in
`Astropy Proposal for Enhancement 2  <https://github.com/astropy/astropy-APEs/blob/master/APE2.rst>`_.

Support for Alt/Az coordinates
------------------------------

The `~astropy.coordinates` package now supports conversion to/from AltAz
coordinates.  This means `~astropy.coordinates` can now be used for planning
observations.  For example::

    >>> from astropy import units as u
    >>> from astropy.time import Time
    >>> from astropy.coordinates import SkyCoord, EarthLocation, AltAz
    >>> greenwich = EarthLocation(lat=51.477*u.deg,lon=0*u.deg)
    >>> albireo = SkyCoord('19h30m43.2805s +27d57m34.8483s')
    >>> altaz = albireo.transform_to(AltAz(location=greenwich, obstime=Time('2014-6-21 0:00')))
    >>> print altaz.alt, altaz.az
    60d32m28.4576s 133d45m36.4967s

For a more detailed outline of this new functionality, see the
:ref:`observing-example` and the `~astropy.coordinates.AltAz` documentation.

To enable this functionality, `~astropy.coordinates` now also contains
the full IAU-sanctioned coordinate transformation stack from ICRS to AltAz.
To view the full set of coordinate frames now available, see the coordinates
:ref:`astropy-coordinates-api`.


New Galactocentric coordinate frame
-----------------------------------



New :ref:`astropy-visualization` subpackage
-------------------------------------------

The new :ref:`Data Visualization <astropy-visualization>` package is intended
to collect functionality that can be helpful when visualizing data. At the
moment, the main functionality is image normalizing (including both scaling and
stretching) but this will be expanded in future. Included in the image
normalization functionality is the ability to compute interval limits on data,
(such as percentile limits), stretching with non-linear functions (such as
square root or arcsinh functions), and the ability to use custom stretches in
`Matplotlib <http://www.matplotlib.org>`_ that are correctly reflected in the
colorbar:

.. plot::
   :include-source:
   :align: center

    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    from astropy.visualization import SqrtStretch
    from astropy.visualization.mpl_normalize import ImageNormalize

    # Generate test image
    image = np.arange(65536).reshape((256, 256))

    # Create normalizer object
    norm = ImageNormalize(vmin=0., vmax=65536, stretch=SqrtStretch())

    fig = plt.figure(figsize=(6,3))
    ax = fig.add_subplot(1,1,1)
    im = ax.imshow(image, norm=norm, origin='lower', aspect='auto')
    fig.colorbar(im)

New :ref:`astropy_analytic_functions` subpackage
------------------------------------------------

This subpackage provides analytic functions that are commonly used in
astronomy. These already understand `~astropy.units.Quantity`, i.e., they can
handle units of input and output parameters. For instance, to calculate the
blackbody flux for 10000K at 6000 Angstrom:

>>> astropy import units as u
>>> from astropy.analytic_functions import blackbody_lambda, blackbody_nu
>>> blackbody_lambda(6000 * u.AA, 10000 * u.K)
<Quantity 15315791.836941158 erg / (Angstrom cm2 s sr)>
>>> blackbody_nu(6000 * u.AA, 10000 * u.K)
<Quantity 0.00018391673686797075 erg / (cm2 Hz s sr)

See :ref:`astropy_analytic_functions` for more details.

In future versions of Astropy, the functions in this module might also be
accessible as `~astropy.modeling.Model` classes.

Fast readers/writers for ASCII files
------------------------------------

The :mod:`astropy.io.ascii` now includes a significantly faster Cython/C engine
for reading and writing ASCII files.  This is available for the following
formats: ``basic``, ``commented_header``, ``csv``, ``no_header``, ``rdb``, and
``tab``.  On average the new engine is about 4 to 5 times faster than the
corresponding pure-Python implementation, and is often comparable to the speed
of the `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/>`_ ASCII file
interface (`read_csv
<http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/io.html#io-read-csv-table>`_ and
`to_csv
<http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/io.html#io-store-in-csv>`_).  The
fast reader has parallel processing option that allows harnessing multiple
cores for input parsing to achieve even greater speed gains.

By default, :func:`~astropy.io.ascii.read` and :func:`~astropy.io.ascii.write`
will attempt to use the fast C engine when dealing with compatible formats.
Certain features of the full read / write interface are not available in the
fast version, in which case the pure-Python version will automatically be used.

For full details including extensive performance testing, see :ref:`fast_ascii_io`.

New features in :ref:`astropy-modeling`
---------------------------------------

.. Compound models and other changes

Support for 'mixin' columns in :ref:`astropy-table`
---------------------------------------------------

.. |Quantity| replace:: :class:`~astropy.units.Quantity`
.. |Time| replace:: :class:`~astropy.time.Time`
.. |SkyCoord| replace:: :class:`~astropy.coordinates.SkyCoord`
.. |Table| replace:: :class:`~astropy.table.Table`
.. |Column| replace:: :class:`~astropy.table.Column`
.. |QTable| replace:: :class:`~astropy.table.QTable`

Version 1.0 of astropy introduces a new concept of the "Mixin
Column" in tables which allows integration of appropriate non-|Column| based
class objects within a |Table| object.  These mixin column objects are not
converted in any way but are used natively.

The available built-in mixin column classes are |Quantity|, |SkyCoord|, and
|Time|.  User classes for array-like objects that support the
:ref:`mixin_protocol` can also be used in tables as mixin columns.

.. Warning::

   While the astropy developers are excited about this new capability and
   intend to improve it, the interface for using mixin columns is not stable at
   this point and it is not recommended for use in production code.

As an example we can create a table and add a time column::

  >>> from astropy.table import Table
  >>> from astropy.time import Time
  >>> t = Table()
  >>> t['index'] = [1, 2]
  >>> t['time'] = Time(['2001-01-02T12:34:56', '2001-02-03T00:01:02'])
  >>> print(t)
  index           time
  ----- -----------------------
      1 2001-01-02T12:34:56.000
      2 2001-02-03T00:01:02.000

The important point here is that the ``time`` column is a bona fide |Time| object::

  >>> t['time']
  <Time object: scale='utc' format='isot' value=['2001-01-02T12:34:56.000' '2001-02-03T00:01:02.000']>
  >>> t['time'].mjd
  array([ 51911.52425926,  51943.00071759])

For all the details, including a new |QTable| class, please see :ref:`mixin_columns`.
