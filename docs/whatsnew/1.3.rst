What's New in Astropy 1.3?
==========================

Overview

Astropy 1.3 is a major release that adds significant new functionality since
the 1.2.x series of releases.

In particular, this release includes:

*

In addition to these major changes, Astropy 1.3 includes a large number of
smaller improvements and bug fixes, which are described in the
:ref:`changelog`. By the numbers:

* xxx issues have been closed since v1.2
* xxx pull requests have been merged since v1.2
* xxx distinct people have contributed code

Other significant changes
-------------------------

The `astropy.coordinates.GCRS` and `astropy.coordinates.PrecessedGeocentric`
frames have been subtly changed such that their ``obsgeoloc`` and ``obsgeovel``
attributes return ``CartesianRepresentation`` objects, rather than ``Quantity``
objects.  This was judged to be an advanced enough use case that this change
will not include a deprecation period (as this would have added substantial
complexity to `astropy.coordinates`). To make code written for earlier versions
compatible with v1.3 and up, simply change all instances of
``<object>.obsgeoloc`` or ``<object>.obsgeovel`` to
``<object>.obsgeoloc.xyz``/``<object>.obsgeovel.xyz``.
