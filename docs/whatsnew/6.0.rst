.. _whatsnew-6.0-geodetic-representation-geometry:

Define Geodetic and Bodycentric Representations via their geometric parameters
==============================================================================

The user may now define custom spheroidal models for the Earth or other planetary
bodies by subclassing `~astropy.coordinates.BaseGeodeticRepresentation` or
`~astropy.coordinates.BaseBodycentricRepresentation` and defining
``_equatorial_radius`` and ``_flattening`` attributes::


    >>> from astropy.coordinates import (BaseGeodeticRepresentation,
    ...     WGS84GeodeticRepresentation, BaseBodycentricRepresentation)
    >>> from astropy import units as u
    >>> class IAU1976EarthGeodeticRepresentation(BaseGeodeticRepresentation):
    ...     _equatorial_radius = 6378140 * u.m
    ...     _flattening = 0.3352805 * u.percent
    >>> representation = IAU1976EarthGeodeticRepresentation(lon=45.8366*u.deg,
    ...     lat=56.1499*u.deg, height=367*u.m)
    >>> representation.to_cartesian() # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP
    <CartesianRepresentation (x, y, z) in m
        (2481112.60371134, 2554647.09482601, 5274064.55958489)>
    >>> representation.represent_as(WGS84GeodeticRepresentation) # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP
    <WGS84GeodeticRepresentation (lon, lat, height) in (rad, rad, m)
        (0.79999959, 0.98000063, 370.01796023)>
    >>> class IAU1976EarthBodycentricRepresentation(BaseBodycentricRepresentation):
    ...     _equatorial_radius = 6378140 * u.m
    ...     _flattening = 0.3352805 * u.percent
    >>> representation.represent_as(IAU1976EarthBodycentricRepresentation) # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP
    <IAU1976EarthBodycentricRepresentation (lon, lat, height) in (rad, rad, m)
        (0.79999959, 0.9768896, 336.12620429)>

See :ref:`astropy-coordinates-create-geodetic` for more details.


.. _whatsnew-6.0-planetary-wcs-bodyfixed:

Body-fixed planetary reference frames and their WCS description
===============================================================

Body-fixed planetary reference frames for Solar System planetary
bodies can be read and written via WCS structures in FITS images, following
`Definitions, Applications, and Best Practices for Planetary FITS <https://doi.org/10.1029/2018EA000388>`_.

See :ref:`creating_planetary_wcs` for an example.

Planetary images or spectral cube WCS description can be manipulated using the
:mod:`~astropy.wcs` module.


.. _whatsnew-6.0-broadcasting-frame-attributes:

Support for Numpy broadcasting over frame data and attributes
=============================================================

Frames in `astropy.coordinates` now support
:doc:`Numpy broadcasting rules <numpy:user/basics.broadcasting>` over both
frame data and frame attributes. Previously, broadcasting was only supported
over framed data. This makes it much easier and faster to do positional
astronomy calculations and transformations on sweeps of parameters.

For example, the user can now create frame objects with scalar data but vector
frame attributes, such as::

    from astropy.coordinates import FK4
    from astropy import units as u

    FK4(1 * u.deg, 2 * u.deg, obstime=["J2000", "J2001"])

Where this really shines is doing fast observability calculations over arrays.
The following example constructs an `~astropy.coordinates.EarthLocation` array
of length :samp:`{L}`, a `~astropy.coordinates.SkyCoord` array of length
:samp:`{M}`, and a `~astropy.time.Time` array of length :samp:`N`. It uses
Numpy broadcasting rules to evaluate a boolean array of shape
:samp:`({L}, {M}, {N})` that is `True` for those observing locations, times,
and sky coordinates, for which the target is above an altitude limit::

    >>> from astropy.coordinates import EarthLocation, AltAz, SkyCoord
    >>> from astropy.coordinates.angles import uniform_spherical_random_surface
    >>> from astropy.time import Time
    >>> from astropy import units as u
    >>> import numpy as np

    >>> L = 25
    >>> M = 100
    >>> N = 50

    >>> # Earth locations of length L
    >>> c = uniform_spherical_random_surface(L)
    >>> locations = EarthLocation.from_geodetic(c.lon, c.lat)

    >>> # Celestial coordinates of length M
    >>> coords = SkyCoord(uniform_spherical_random_surface(M))

    >>> # Observation times of length N
    >>> obstimes = Time('2023-08-04') + np.linspace(0, 24, N) * u.hour

    >>> # AltAz coordinates of shape (L, M, N)
    >>> frame = AltAz(
    ...     location=locations[:, np.newaxis, np.newaxis],
    ...     obstime=obstimes[np.newaxis, np.newaxis, :])
    >>> altaz = coords[np.newaxis, :, np.newaxis].transform_to(frame)  # doctest: +REMOTE_DATA

    >>> min_altitude = 30 * u.deg
    >>> is_above_altitude_limit = (altaz.alt > min_altitude)  # doctest: +REMOTE_DATA
    >>> is_above_altitude_limit.shape  # doctest: +REMOTE_DATA
    (25, 100, 50)

.. _whatsnew-6.0-cosmology-latex-export:

Updates to `~astropy.cosmology`
===============================

Writing to LaTeX
----------------

The :class:`~astropy.cosmology.Cosmology` class in :mod:`~astropy.cosmology` now
supports the latex format in its :attr:`~astropy.cosmology.Cosmology.write()`
method, allowing users to export a cosmology object to a LaTeX table.::

    >>> from astropy.cosmology import Planck18
    >>> Planck18.write("example_cosmology.tex", format="ascii.latex")

This will write the cosmology object to a file in LaTeX format,
with appropriate formatting of units and table alignment.

Renaming fields in I/O
----------------------

Most I/O methods in :mod:`~astropy.cosmology` (accessed by
:meth:`~astropy.cosmology.Cosmology.read`,
:meth:`~astropy.cosmology.Cosmology.write`,
:meth:`~astropy.cosmology.Cosmology.from_format`,
:meth:`~astropy.cosmology.Cosmology.to_format`) now support
:ref:`renaming fields<cosmology_io_renaming_fields>`.

For example, to rename the ``H0`` field to ``Hubble`` when converting to a table
format::

    >>> from astropy.cosmology import Planck18
    >>> Planck18.to_format("astropy.table")  # No renaming
    <QTable length=1>
      name        H0        Om0    Tcmb0    Neff      m_nu      Ob0
             km / (Mpc s)            K                 eV
      str8     float64    float64 float64 float64  float64[3] float64
    -------- ------------ ------- ------- ------- ----------- -------
    Planck18        67.66 0.30966  2.7255   3.046 0.0 .. 0.06 0.04897

    >>> Planck18.to_format("astropy.table", rename={"H0": "Hubble"})
    <QTable length=1>
      name      Hubble      Om0    Tcmb0    Neff      m_nu      Ob0
             km / (Mpc s)            K                 eV
      str8     float64    float64 float64 float64  float64[3] float64
    -------- ------------ ------- ------- ------- ----------- -------
    Planck18        67.66 0.30966  2.7255   3.046 0.0 .. 0.06 0.04897


:class:`~astropy.cosmology.Parameter` as a :func:`~dataclasses.dataclass`
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The :class:`~astropy.cosmology.Parameter` class is now a :func:`~dataclasses.dataclass`.
This means that the :mod:`dataclasses` machinery can be used to work with
:class:`~astropy.cosmology.Parameter` objects. For example::

    >>> from dataclasses import replace
    >>> from astropy.cosmology import FlatLambdaCDM
    >>> H0 = FlatLambdaCDM.H0
    >>> H0
    Parameter(derived=False, unit=Unit("km / (Mpc s)"), equivalencies=[], ...)
    >>> replace(H0, derived=True)
    Parameter(derived=True, unit=Unit("km / (Mpc s)"), equivalencies=[], ...)

    >>> from dataclasses import asdict
    >>> asdict(H0)
    {'derived': False, 'unit': Unit("km / (Mpc s)"), 'equivalencies': [], ...


It's also much easier to create new :class:`~astropy.cosmology.Parameter` subclasses

    >>> from dataclasses import make_dataclass, field, fields
    >>> from astropy.cosmology import Parameter
    >>> NewP = make_dataclass("NewP", [("newfield", float, field(default=None))], bases=(Parameter,), frozen=True)
    >>> tuple(f.name for f in fields(NewP))
    (..., 'newfield')


.. _whatsnew-6.0-iers-data:

Updates to how IERS data are handled
====================================

Some parts of astropy, such as coordinate and time transformations, rely on
tables from the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems (IERS)
service (these are the IERS-A, IERS-B, and leap second tables). IERS-A used
to always be automatically downloaded, whereas the IERS-B and leap second
tables were bundled with astropy. All tables are now bundled in the standalone
`astropy-iers-data <https://github.com/astropy/astropy-iers-data>`_ package
which is regularly updated and installed automatically when astropy is
installed.

The main benefit of moving the files to this package is to make it easier to
use astropy without an internet connection, and to facilitate updating the
tables if needed. Users that want to ensure they have the latest available
IERS data can now install the latest version of the
`astropy-iers-data`_ package using ``pip`` or ``conda``, or alternatively
download the package manually and transfer it to a computer that has no
public internet connection.
