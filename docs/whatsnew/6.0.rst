Define Geodetic Representations via their geometric parameters
==============================================================

The user may now define custom spheroidal models for the Earth or other planetary
bodies by subclassing `~astropy.coordinates.BaseGeodeticRepresentation` and defining
``_equatorial_radius`` and ``_flattening`` attributes::


    >>> from astropy.coordinates import BaseGeodeticRepresentation, WGS84GeodeticRepresentation
    >>> from astropy import units as u
    >>> class IAU1976EarthGeodeticRepresentation(BaseGeodeticRepresentation):
    ...     _equatorial_radius = 6378140 * u.m
    ...     _flattening = 0.3352805 * u.percent
    >>> representation = IAU1976EarthGeodeticRepresentation(lon=45.8366*u.deg,
    ...     lat=56.1499*u.deg, height=367*u.m)
    >>> representation.to_cartesian() # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP
    <CartesianRepresentation (x, y, z) in m
        (2481112.60371134, 2554647.09482601, 5274064.55958489)>
    >>> representation.represent_as(WGS84GeodeticRepresentation) # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP
    <WGS84GeodeticRepresentation (lon, lat, height) in (rad, rad, m)
        (0.79999959, 0.98000063, 370.01796023)>
