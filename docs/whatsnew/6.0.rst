.. _whatsnew-6.0-geodetic-representation-geometry:

Define Geodetic Representations via their geometric parameters
==============================================================

The `~astropy.coordinates.BaseGeodeticRepresentation` now exposes its geometric
parameters via the attributes ``_equatorial_radius`` and ``_flattening``.
The user may now define custom spheroidal models for the Earth or other Solar System
bodies::

    >>> from astropy.coordinates import BaseGeodeticRepresentation
    >>> from astropy import units as u
    >>> class IAU1976EarthGeodeticRepresentation(BaseGeodeticRepresentation):
    ...     _equatorial_radius = 6378140 * u.m
    ...     _flattening = 0.003352805 * u.dimensionless_unscaled
    >>> representation = IAU1976EarthGeodeticRepresentation(lon=0.8*u.radian,
    ...     lat=0.98*u.radian, height=367*u.m)
    >>> representation.to_cartesian()
    <CartesianRepresentation (x, y, z) in m
        (2481113.87541373, 2554650.51055863, 5274062.32189811)>
