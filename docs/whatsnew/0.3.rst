What's New in Astropy 0.3
=========================

WCS
---

When reading FITS headers, warnings will be displayed about any
non-standard WCS keywords that were fixed up to become standard
compliant.

The included version of `wcslib` has been upgraded to version 4.17.

Units
-----

Quantities can now conveniently get their values in a requested unit,
simply by using `quantity.SOME_UNIT`, for example::

    >>> q = 180.0 * u.degree
    >>> q.radian
    3.141592653589793
