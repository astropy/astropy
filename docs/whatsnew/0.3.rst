=========================
What's New in Astropy 0.3
=========================

WCS
---

When reading FITS headers, warnings will be displayed about any
non-standard WCS keywords that were fixed up to become standard
compliant.

The included version of `wcslib` has been upgraded to version 4.17.

io.votable
----------

`io.votable` now includes support for the `VOTable 1.3 proposed
recommendation
<http://www.ivoa.net/documents/VOTable/20130315/PR-VOTable-1.3-20130315.html>`_.
Notably, this includes a new binary representation that supports
masking of any data type.

Backwards-Incompatible Changes
------------------------------

* The `coordinates.angles.AngularSeparation`'s initializer argument order
  has been changed from ``lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2`` to
  ``lon1, lat1, lon2, lat2``.  A warning will be shown in this version
  indicating that the change occurred, but this will be removed in the
  next version.


Warnings about backwards incompatible changes can be disabled by doing::

    import warnings
    from astropy.utils.exceptions import AstropyBackwardsIncompatibleChangeWarning
    warnings.simplefilter('ignore', AstropyBackwardsIncompatibleChangeWarning)

Units
-----

Quantities can now conveniently get their values in a requested unit,
simply by using `quantity.SOME_UNIT`, for example::

    >>> q = 180.0 * u.degree
    >>> q.radian
    3.141592653589793
