What's New in Astropy 0.2
=========================

VOTable XML support
===================

The name of the VOTable XML handling package has changed from
`astropy.io.vo` to `astropy.io.votable`.

The `unit` attribute is now an `astropy.units.Unit` object, so unit
conversions can easily be supported.  The CDS unit format used by
VOTable XML is now fully supported as a result.

Masked values are now handled by a single array, rather than a pair of
arrays.

The `precision` and `width` attributes of each field are now handled
correctly as per the VOTable XML specification.  This may result in
the output changing.

Each `TABLE` section of a `VOTable` XML file can be converted to/from
an `astropy.table.Table` object, which allows much easier editing of
the columns than a regular Numpy structured array.

A standalone `volint` script is available to validate the contents of
VOTable XML files.

The default setting for `pedantic` mode can be set using a
configuration parameter (`astropy.io.vo.PEDANTIC`).
