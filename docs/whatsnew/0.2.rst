What's New in Astropy 0.2
=========================

Units and quantities
====================

:ref:`astropy-units` handles defining and converting between physical
units, and performing arithmetic with physical quantities (numbers
with associated units).

Units can be converted to one another:

  >>> from astropy import units as u
  >>> # Convert from parsec to meter
  >>> u.pc.to(u.m)
  3.0856776e+16

It also handles equivalencies that hold true in certain contexts, such
as that between wavelength and frequency::

  # Wavelength to frequency doesn't normally work
  >>> u.nm.to(u.Hz, [1000, 2000])
  UnitsException: 'nm' (length) and 'Hz' (frequency) are not convertible
  # ...but by passing an equivalency unit (spectral()), it does...
  >>> u.nm.to(u.Hz, [1000, 2000], equivalencies=u.spectral())
  array([  2.99792458e+14,   1.49896229e+14])

Also included in the `astropy.units` package is the
`~astropy.units.quantity.Quantity` object, which represents a
numerical value with an associated unit. These objects support
arithmetic with other numbers and `~astropy.units.quantity.Quantity`
objects and preserve units::

   >>> from astropy import units as u
   >>> 15.1*u.meter / (32.0*u.second)
   <Quantity 0.471875 m / (s)>
   >>> 3.0*u.kilometer / (130.51*u.meter/u.second)
   <Quantity 0.0229867443108 km s / (m)>
   >>> (3.0*u.kilometer / (130.51*u.meter/u.second)).simplify_units()
   <Quantity 22.9867443108 s>
