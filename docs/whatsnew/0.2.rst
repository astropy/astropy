What's New in Astropy 0.2
=========================

WCS
===

When reading FITS headers, the default value of `relax` is `True`, in
order to accept all non-standard keywords that `wcslib` understands.
This should make `astropy.wcs` handle more FITS files by default, but
may introduce a change in behavior in some edge cases.  Likewise for
writing FITS headers, the default value of `relax` is `WCSHDO_safe`,
meaning it will write all non-standard exceptions that are considered
safe and unambiguous.  This should make the FITS files produced by
`astropy.wcs` supported by a larger range of third-party tools, but
may introduce changes in behavior in some edge cases.

The WCS transformation functions, when provided for a separate array
for each input axis, will now broadcast the arrays correctly and
return the output in the broadcasted shape.  This makes using a
constant for one of the axes possible.

The units in a WCS object (`CUNITij`) are now `astropy.units.Unit`
objects, so operations on those units may be performed.

The included version of `wcslib` has been upgraded to version 4.16.
