``Quantity.to_string`` supports ``formatter`` for formatting
==============================================================

The :meth:`~astropy.units.Quantity.to_string` method now supports a ``formatter`` parameter.
This feature supports both Python's format specification mini-language via format strings and
custom formatting through callables. This enables users to have explicit and consistent control
over the numerical representation of quantities, accommodating a wide range of formatting needs.

Previously, the method primarily relied on the ``precision`` parameter for format control, which dictated
the number of significant digits and did not provide much freedom in the latex format.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from astropy import units as u
    >>> q = u.Quantity(123.456, u.m)
    >>> custom_format = lambda x: f"\\approx {float(x):.1f}"
    >>> q.to_string(formatter=custom_format, format='latex')
    '$\\approx 123.5 \\; \\mathrm{m}$'
    >>> q.to_string(formatter='.3e', format='latex')
    '$1.235 \\times 10^{2} \\; \\mathrm{m}$'
    >>> q.to_string(precision=3, format='latex')
    '$123 \\; \\mathrm{m}$'
