.. _whatsnew-7.1-table-spaces:

Trailing whitespace in ``Table`` string columns can now be stripped
===================================================================

Strings in FITS binary tables are sometimes padded with trailing whitespace.
It is now possible to remove those when reading a table with
``(Q)Table.read("filename.fits", strip_spaces=True)``. The default behavior is
not changed yet to preserve compatibility with codes that might rely on this,
it will change in the next major version (v8.0).

.. _whatsnew-7.1-tdat-reader:

Reading and writing TDAT files with ``astropy.io.ascii``
========================================================

The TDAT format, specified by https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/dbdocs/tdat.html,
is now supported by the Unified File Read/Write Interface.

Note that this format is compatible with ``Table`` objects with integer, float,
and/or string data types, but not ``QTable`` objects or other data types.

.. _whatsnew-7.1-covariance:

Constructing, accessing, and storing covariance matrices for N-dimensional data
===============================================================================

We provide a new utility class that provides basic functionality for covariance
matrices associated `~astropy.nddata.NDData` objects via the new
`~astropy.nddata.Covariance` class.  See the full :ref:`nddata-covariance`
documentation.
