.. _whatsnew-7.1-table-spaces:

Trailing whitespace in ``Table`` string columns can now be stripped
===================================================================

Strings in FITS binary tables are sometimes padded with trailing whitespace.
It is now possible to remove those when reading a table with
``(Q)Table.read("filename.fits", strip_spaces=True)``. The default behavior is
not changed yet to preserve compatibility with codes that might rely on this,
it will change in the next major version (v8.0).
