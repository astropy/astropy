.. _whatsnew-2.0-table-uni-sandwich:

Easier use of efficient bytestring Table columns in Python 3
============================================================

Working with bytestring Table columns (numpy ``'S'`` dtype) in Python
3 has been made more convenient because it is now possible to compare
and set array elements with the natural Python string (``str``) type.
Previously one had to use the Python ``bytes`` type and bytestring literals
like ``b'hello'``.  This change allows working with ASCII data columns
in Python 3 using only 1-byte per character instead of the default
4-bytes per character for the numpy ``'U'`` unicode dtype.  For large
datasets this improves memory performance.

Please see :ref:`bytestring-columns-python-3` for details.  Note that no
change has been made to behavior for Python 2.

.. note::

     This introduces an API change that affects comparison of
     bytestring column elements in Python 3.

     If comparison with ``str`` instead of ``bytes`` is a problem
     (and ``bytes`` is really more logical), please open an issue
     on GitHub.

.. _whatsnew-2.0-cosmo-def:

No relativistic species by default in cosmological models
=========================================================

For all of the built in cosmological model types (e.g., FlatLambdaCDM)
the default CMB temperature at z=0 is now 0K, which corresponds to no
contributions from photons or neutrinos (massive or otherwise).  This
does not affect built in literature models (such as the WMAP or Planck
models).  The justification is to avoid including mass-energy components
that the user has not explicitly requested.  This is a non-backwards
compatible change, although the effects are small for most use cases.

Convolution has undergone a significant overhaul to make fft and direct
convolution consistent.  They keyword arguments have changed and the behavior
of `~astropy.convolution.convolve` is no longer the same as in versions prior to
2.0 (although `~astropy.convolution.convolve_fft`'s behavior remains unchanged).
The details are given on the :ref:`astropy convolution <astropy_convolve>`.

.. _whatsnew-2.0-conesearch-astroquery:

Cone search module (``astropy.vo.conesearch``) moved to astroquery
==================================================================

The cone search module has been moved to `Astroquery
<http://astroquery.readthedocs.io>`_ (0.3.5 and later) and will be removed from
Astropy in a future version. The API here will be preserved as "classic" API in
Astroquery, however some configuration behavior might change; See the Astroquery
documentation for new usage details.

.. _whatsnew-2.0-samp-moved:

SAMP module moved to `astropy.samp`
===================================

The SAMP (Simple Application Messaging Protocol) module, formerly available
in ``astropy.samp``, has now been moved to `astropy.samp`, so you should
update any imports to this module.

.. _whatsnew-2.0-SigmaClip:

New `~astropy.stats.SigmaClip` class
====================================

A new :class:`~astropy.stats.SigmaClip` class was added as an
object-oriented interface for sigma clipping::

    >>> from astropy.stats import SigmaClip
    >>> data = [1, 5, 6, 8, 100, 5, 3, 2]
    >>> sigclip = SigmaClip(sigma=2, iters=5)
    >>> print(sigclip)  # doctest: +SKIP
    <SigmaClip>
        sigma: 3
        sigma_lower: None
        sigma_upper: None
        iters: 10
        cenfunc: <function median at 0x108dbde18>
        stdfunc: <function std at 0x103ab52f0>
    >>> sigclip(data)
    masked_array(data = [1 5 6 8 -- 5 3 2],
                 mask = [False False False False  True False False False],
           fill_value = 999999)

Note that once the ``sigclip`` instance is defined above, it can be
applied to other data, using the same, already-defined, sigma-clipping
parameters.

.. _whatsnew-2.0-ddof:

New ``std_ddof`` keyword to :func:`~astropy.stats.sigma_clipped_stats`
======================================================================

A new ``std_ddof`` keyword option was added to
:func:`~astropy.stats.sigma_clipped_stats`.  This keyword represents
the delta degrees of freedom for the standard deviation calculation.
Specifically, the divisor used in the calculation is ``N - std_ddof``,
where ``N`` represents the number of array elements.  The ``std_ddof``
default value is zero.

.. _whatsnew-2.0-stats-biweight-midcov:

New ``biweight_midcovariance`` function in `astropy.stats`
==========================================================

A new ``biweight_midcovariance`` function was added to `astropy.stats`.
This is a robust and resistant estimator of the covariance matrix.
For example::

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from astropy.stats import biweight_midcovariance
    >>> # Generate 2D normal sampling of points
    >>> rng = np.random.RandomState(1)
    >>> d = np.array([rng.normal(0, 1, 200), rng.normal(0, 3, 200)])
    >>> # Introduce an obvious outlier
    >>> d[0,0] = 30.0
    >>> # Calculate biweight covariances
    >>> bw_cov = biweight_midcovariance(d)
    >>> # Print out recovered standard deviations
    >>> print(np.around(np.sqrt(bw_cov.diagonal()), 1))
    [ 0.9  3.1]

.. _whatsnew-2.0-stats-k-func:

New statistical estimators for Ripley's K Function
==================================================

New statistical estimators for Ripley's K Function, ``RipleysKEstimator``,
in `astropy.stats`. For example:

.. plot::

    import numpy as np
    from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
    from astropy.stats import RipleysKEstimator
    z = np.random.uniform(low=5, high=10, size=(100, 2))
    Kest = RipleysKEstimator(area=25, x_max=10, y_max=10, x_min=5, y_min=5)
    r = np.linspace(0, 2.5, 100)
    plt.plot(r, Kest.poisson(r), label='poisson')
    plt.plot(r, Kest(data=z, radii=r, mode='none'), label='none')
    plt.plot(r, Kest(data=z, radii=r, mode='translation'), label='translation')
    plt.plot(r, Kest(data=z, radii=r, mode='ohser'), label='ohser')
    plt.plot(r, Kest(data=z, radii=r, mode='var-width'), label='var-width')
    plt.plot(r, Kest(data=z, radii=r, mode='ripley'), label='ripley')
    plt.legend(loc='upper left')

.. _whatsnew-2.0-bintablehdu-from_table:

New way to instantiate a ``BinTableHDU`` directly from a ``Table``
==================================================================

A new way to instantiate a FITS ``BinTableHDU`` directly from a ``Table``
object. For example::

    >>> from astropy.io import fits
    >>> from astropy.table import Table
    >>> tab = Table([[1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b', 'c'], [2.3, 4.5, 6.7]],
    ...             names=['a', 'b', 'c'], dtype=['i', 'U1', 'f'])
    >>> hdu = fits.BinTableHDU(tab)

.. _whatsnew-2.0-fits-printdiff:

New ``printdiff`` convenience function for FITS
===============================================

A new ``printdiff`` convenience function was added for comparison between
FITS files. For example::

    >>> from astropy.io import fits
    >>> hdu1 = fits.ImageHDU([1, 2, 3])
    >>> hdu2 = fits.ImageHDU([1, 2.1, 3])
    >>> fits.printdiff(hdu1, hdu2)

    Headers contain differences:
      Keyword BITPIX   has different values:
         a> 64
         b> -64
          ? +

    Data contains differences:
      Data differs at [2]:
           (int64) a> 2
         (float64) b> 2.1000000000000001
      1 different pixels found (33.33% different).

.. _whatsnew-2.0-molar-mass:

New ``molar_mass_amu`` unit equivalency
=======================================

A new equivalency named ``molar_mass_amu`` to convert between ``g/mol`` unit
to atomic mass unit (amu). For example::

    >>> from astropy import constants as const
    >>> from astropy import units as u
    >>> x = 1 * (u.g / u.mol)
    >>> y = 1 * u.u
    >>> x.to(u.u, equivalencies=u.molar_mass_amu())
    <Quantity 1.0 u>
    >>> y.to(u.g/u.mol, equivalencies=u.molar_mass_amu())
    <Quantity 1.0 g / mol>

.. _whatsnew-2.0-models-units:

New unit support for most models
================================

Most Astropy models now can handle inputs with units, and produce the
appropriate outputs with units as well. Some models cannot support this due
to their definitions (e.g., Legendre, Hermite, etc), while some will have
this capability added in a future release. Example usage::

    >>> from astropy import units as u
    >>> from astropy.modeling.models import Gaussian1D
    >>> g = Gaussian1D(amplitude=1*u.J, mean=1*u.m, stddev=0.1*u.m)
    >>> g([3, 4, 5.5] * u.cm)
    <Quantity [  3.70353198e-21,  9.72098502e-21,  4.05703276e-20] J>

.. _whatsnew-2.0-n-submodels:

New ``n_submodels`` shared method in single and compound models
===============================================================

A new ``n_submodels`` shared method in single and compound models.
This enables accurate reporting of number of sub-models in a given model.
For example::

    >>> from astropy.modeling.models import Gaussian1D, Gaussian2D
    >>> g1 = Gaussian1D()
    >>> g1.n_submodels()
    1
    >>> g2 = g1 + Gaussian1D()
    >>> g2.n_submodels()
    2

.. _whatsnew-2.0-with-bounding-box:

Two new optional arguments when evaluating a model - ``with_bounding_box`` and ``fill_value``
=============================================================================================

Two new arguments can be passed when evaluating a model to specify the bounding box
should be respected. If ``with_bounding_box=True`` and a model has a bounding_box,
the output values corresponding to inputs outside the bounding box are set to ``fill_value``.
For example::

    >>> from astropy.modeling.models import Polynomial1D
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> x = np.arange(-5, 5)
    >>> p = Polynomial1D(1, c0=2, c1=3)
    >>> p.bounding_box = (-1, 5)
    >>> p(x, with_bounding_box=True, fill_value=-100)
    array([-100., -100., -100., -100.,   -1.,    2.,    5.,    8.,   11.,   14.])


.. _whatsnew-2.0-no-bundled-pytest:

No more bundled ``pytest`` with Astropy distribution
====================================================

The bundled version of ``pytest`` has now been removed, but the
``astropy.tests.helper.pytest`` import will continue to work properly.
Affiliated packages should nevertheless transition to importing ``pytest``
directly rather than from `astropy.tests.helper`. This also means that
``pytest`` is now a formal requirement for testing for both Astropy and
for affiliated packages.

.. _whatsnew-2.0-ccddata-class:

New image class ``CCDData`` added
=================================

A new class, ``CCDData``, has been added to the ``nddata`` package. It can
read from/write to FITS files, provides methods for arithmetic operations
with propagation of uncertainty, and support for binary masks.


.. _whatsnew-2.0-ascii-ecsv-mixins:

Store astropy core object types in ASCII ECSV table file
========================================================

It is now possible to store the following :ref:`mixin column
<mixin_columns>` types in an ASCII :ref:`ECSV
<ecsv_format>` table file.  The table file can then be read back
into astropy with no loss of object data or attributes.

- `astropy.time.Time`
- `astropy.time.TimeDelta`
- `astropy.units.Quantity`
- `astropy.coordinates.Latitude`
- `astropy.coordinates.Longitude`
- `astropy.coordinates.Angle`
- `astropy.coordinates.Distance`
- `astropy.coordinates.EarthLocation`
- `astropy.coordinates.SkyCoord`


.. _whatsnew-2.0-velocity-corrections:

Barycentric/heliocentric radial velocity corrections
====================================================

`astropy.coordinates.SkyCoord` now have a
`~astropy.coordinates.SkyCoord.radial_velocity_correction` method which can be
used to compute heliocentric and barycentric corrections for radial velocity
measurements.  While in the future this may use the mechanisms described
in :ref:`whatsnew-2.0-coordinates-velocities`, currently it uses a simpler
algorithm for numerical stability.


.. _whatsnew-2.0-coordinates-velocities:

Experimental velocity support in ``astropy.coordinates``
========================================================

``astropy.coordinates`` frame objects now contains experimental support for
storing and transforming velocities.  This includes support for "differential"
objects which contain differences of representations.
