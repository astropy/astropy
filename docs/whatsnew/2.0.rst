Easier use of efficient bytestring Table columns in Python 3
============================================================

Working with bytestring Table columns (numpy ``'S'`` dtype) in Python
3 has been made more convenient because it is now possible to compare
and set array elements with the natural Python string (``str``) type.
Previously one had to use the Python ``bytes`` type and bytestring literals
like ``b'hello'``.  This change allows working with ASCII data columns
in Python 3 using only 1-byte per character instead of the default
4-bytes per character for the numpy ``'U'`` unicode dtype.  For large
datasets this improves memory performance.

Please see :ref:`bytestring-columns-python-3` for details.  Note that no
change has been made to behavior for Python 2.

.. Note:: This introduces an API change that affects comparison of
     bytestring column elements in Python 3.
