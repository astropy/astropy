.. _whatsnew-8.0-cosmo-simplification:

Cosmology Module Simplification
===============================

The deprecated module-level shim files in ``astropy.cosmology`` have been removed. These
compatibility modules were originally deprecated in v7.1. With this release, all
cosmology classes and functions must be imported directly from ``astropy.cosmology``.

The following deprecated modules have been removed:

- ``astropy.cosmology.connect``
- ``astropy.cosmology.core``
- ``astropy.cosmology.flrw``
- ``astropy.cosmology.funcs``
- ``astropy.cosmology.parameter``

**Migration Guide**

If your code was still using the old import paths, you need to update them to import
directly from ``astropy.cosmology``.

Before:

.. code-block:: python

    from astropy.cosmology.flrw import FlatLambdaCDM
    from astropy.cosmology.core import Cosmology
    from astropy.cosmology.funcs import z_at_value

After:

.. code-block:: python

    from astropy.cosmology import Cosmology, FlatLambdaCDM, z_at_value

.. _whatsnew-8.0-codata2022:

CODATA 2022 is now default in constants
=======================================

CODATA 2022 has replaced CODATA 2018 as default. ``astropyconst80`` is
available for ``constants`` science state, combining CODATA 2022 with
IAU 2015. To use previous version of CODATA, see :ref:`astropy-constants-prior`.
