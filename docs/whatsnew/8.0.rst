Cosmology Module Simplification
================================

The deprecated module-level shim files in ``astropy.cosmology`` have been removed. These
compatibility modules were originally deprecated in v7.1. With this release, all
cosmology classes and functions must be imported directly from ``astropy.cosmology``.

The following deprecated modules have been removed:

- ``astropy.cosmology.connect``
- ``astropy.cosmology.core``
- ``astropy.cosmology.flrw``

**Migration Guide**

If your code was still using the old import paths, you need to update them to import
directly from ``astropy.cosmology``.

Before:

.. code-block:: python

    from astropy.cosmology.flrw import FlatLambdaCDM
    from astropy.cosmology.core import Cosmology

After:

.. code-block:: python

    from astropy.cosmology import Cosmology, FlatLambdaCDM
