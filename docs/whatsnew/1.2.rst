What's New in Astropy 1.2?
==========================

Overview
--------

Astropy 1.2 is a major release that adds significant new functionality since
the 1.1.x series of releases.

In particular, this release includes:

*
*
*

In addition to these major changes, Astropy 1.2 includes a large number of
smaller improvements and bug fixes, which are described in the
:ref:`changelog`. By the numbers:

* ??? issues have been closed since v1.1
* ??? pull requests have been merged since v1.1
* ??? distinct people have contributed code

Solar system ephemerides
------------------------

Positions of the major solar-system bodies, including the moon, can now be
calculated.  These integrate with the coordinates subpackage, allowing use of
apparent (e.g. ``AltAz``) positions or barycentric values.  These can be
calculated using either using built-in approximations or more precisely 
using JPL ephemeris models (the latter requiring the ``jplephem`` package).
For more details, see :ref:`astropy-coordinates-solarsystem`.

Barycentric light-travel time corrections
-----------------------------------------

The :class:`~astropy.time.Time` class has gained a new method
:meth:`~astropy.time.Time.light_travel_time` for calculating barycentric
(or heliocentric) corrections. For more details, see 
:ref:`time-light-travel-time`.

Astrometric coordinate frames
-----------------------------



Lomb-scargle periodograms
-------------------------



Other new statistics features
-----------------------------



Apparent/absolute bolometric magnitudes and other new units
-----------------------------------------------------------



Zscale implementation
---------------------

The `zscale <http://iraf.net/forum/viewtopic.php?showtopic=134139>`_ algorithm
from IRAF is now included in Astropy's :doc:`visualization
<../visualization/normalization>` sub-package, and available as
a `~astropy.visualization.ZScaleInterval` interval class. The implementation is
based on `Numdisplay’s <http://stsdas.stsci.edu/numdisplay/>`_ one, slightly
modified to expose more arguments and work with data with any number of
dimensions.

NDData improvements
-------------------


Arithmetic and uncertainty handling have been enhanced for astropy 1.2, and a
new class, `astropy.nddata.NDDataRef`, has been added that should be the
starting point for new users of `astropy.nddata`. One can now do arithmetic
between an `astropy.nddata.NDDataRef` object and a scalar, an
`astropy.units.Quantity` or another `astropy.nddata.NDDataRef` object (or any
class that implements the nddata interface). Limited support for propagating
correlated errors was added to `astropy.nddata.StdDevUncertainty`.

Several internal changes were made to the classes in the nddata package to
make writing custom classes that implement the nddata interface more
straightforward.

Automatic updates to IERS Earth rotation data
---------------------------------------------

The `astropy.utils.iers` sub-package provides access to the tables provided by
the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems (IERS) service.  These
are used in `astropy.time` to tranform to/from UT1 values and for determining
Earth orientation for celestional-to-terrestrial coordinate transformations (in
`astropy.coordinates`).

Starting with astropy 1.2, the latest IERS values (which include approximately
one year of predictive values) are automatically downloaded from the IERS
service when required.  This happens when a time or coordinate transformation
needs a value which is not already available via the download cache.

For details see the `astropy.utils.iers` sub-package documentation.

New example gallery
-------------------

The Astropy documentation now contains an example gallery that highlights key
functionality of the package in short snippets of code with descriptive text.
The examples are meant to demonstrate the functionality and interoperability of
the subpackages in shorter-form worked examples. Longer form tutorials are still
maintained at `<http://tutorials.astropy.org/>`_.


Other significant changes
-------------------------

Astropy now requires Numpy 1.7.0 or later.
