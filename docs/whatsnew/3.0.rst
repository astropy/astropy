.. _whatsnew-3.0-velocities-skycoord-vel:

Full support for velocities in ``astropy.coordinates``
======================================================

The :class:`~astropy.coordinates.SkyCoord` object now supports representing and
transforming velocity components along with positional coordinates. For example,
to transform equatorial (ICRS) proper motions to the Galactic coordinate
system::

    >>> import astropy.units as u
    >>> import astropy.coordinates as coord
    >>> c = coord.SkyCoord(ra=86.7 * u.deg, dec=53.09 * u.deg,
    ...                    pm_ra_cosdec=112*u.mas/u.yr,
    ...                    pm_dec=35*u.mas/u.yr)
    >>> c.galactic # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP
    <SkyCoord (Galactic): (l, b) in deg
        ( 159.1426742,  12.46482854)
     (pm_l_cosb, pm_b) in mas / yr
        ( 23.48718747,  114.96674312)>


.. _whatsnew-3.0-velocities-skycoord-space-motion:

Support for position updates based on source motion for ``SkyCoord`` objects
============================================================================

:class:`~astropy.coordinates.SkyCoord` now also has a method for computing the
position of a source at a new epoch, given position and some velocity data at a
specified epoch. For example, the reference epoch for the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric
Solution (TGAS) is J2015.0, but we might want to compute the position of a
source at a prior epoch to cross-match to an old catalog, or compute the
position at a future epoch to observe the source. We can do this with
:meth:`~astropy.coordinates.SkyCoord.apply_space_motion`::

    >>> from astropy.time import Time
    >>> c = coord.SkyCoord(ra=86.7 * u.deg, dec=53.09 * u.deg,
    ...                    distance=100*u.pc,
    ...                    pm_ra_cosdec=112*u.mas/u.yr,
    ...                    pm_dec=35*u.mas/u.yr,
    ...                    obstime=Time('J2015.0'))
    >>> c.apply_space_motion(Time('J2000')) # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP
    <SkyCoord (ICRS): (ra, dec, distance) in (deg, deg, pc)
        ( 86.69922295,  53.08985416,  100.00000008)
     (pm_ra, pm_dec, radial_velocity) in (mas / yr, mas / yr, km / s)
        ( 186.49140891,  35.00121452, -0.00047467)>
    >>> c.apply_space_motion(Time(58228.62, format='mjd')) # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP
    <SkyCoord (ICRS): (ra, dec, distance) in (deg, deg, pc)
        ( 86.70017096,  53.09003208,  99.99999998)
     (pm_ra, pm_dec, radial_velocity) in (mas / yr, mas / yr, km / s)
        ( 186.49295097,  34.99973279,  0.00010443)>

For a more in-depth example and more explanation of this feature, see
:ref:`astropy-coordinates-apply-space-motion`.


.. _whatsnew-3.0-constants-contextmanager:

Context managers for versioned ``astropy.constants``
====================================================

The context manager :func:`~astropy.constants.set_enabled_constants` is now
available for temporarily switching to an older version of constants::

    >>> from astropy import constants as const
    >>> with const.set_enabled_constants('astropyconst13'):
    ...     print(const.h)
      Name   = Planck constant
      Value  = 6.62606957e-34
      Uncertainty  = 2.9e-41
      Unit  = J s
      Reference = CODATA 2010
    >>> print(const.h)
      Name   = Planck constant
      Value  = 6.62607004e-34
      Uncertainty  = 8.1e-42
      Unit  = J s
      Reference = CODATA 2014

.. _whatsnew-3.0-showtable:

``showtable`` command line script
=================================

The new command-line tool ``showtable`` can be used to print the content of
tables for the formats supported by the unified I/O interface (ASCII, FITS,
HDF5 or VOTable)::

    $ showtable astropy/io/fits/tests/data/table.fits

     target V_mag
    ------- -----
    NGC1001  11.1
    NGC1002  12.3
    NGC1003  15.2

To get full documentation on the usage and available options do ``showtable
--help``.

.. _whatsnew-3.0-hdf5-mixins:

HDF5 Table writer supports mix-in columns (e.g. time, coordinates, etc.)
========================================================================


.. _whatsnew-3.0-fits-time-support:

Support for FITS time standard
==============================


.. _whatsnew-3.0-fits-performance:

FITS table performance enhancements
===================================

The performance for reading and writing FITS tables has been significantly
improved, in particular for cases where the tables contain one or more string
columns and when done through the ``astropy.table.Table`` interface.  The
``Table.read`` now supports a ``memmap=`` keyword argument to control whether
or not to use memory mapping when reading the table, and ``fits.open`` supports
a new keyword argument ``character_as_bytes`` to return character columns as
Numpy byte arrays (Numpy type 'S'), which uses less memory.

.. _whatsnew-3.0-kuiper-functions:

Kuiper functions added to ``astropy.stats``
===========================================

.. _whatsnew-3.0-lomb-scargle-false-alarm:

False alarm probabilities in ``astropy.stats.LombScargle``
==========================================================

:class:`~astropy.stats.LombScargle` now supports estimation of false alarm probabilities, using the :meth:`~astropy.stats.LombScargle.false_alarm_probability` and :meth:`~astropy.stats.LombScargle.false_alarm_level` methods. Supported approaches to false alarm estimation include a common heuristic based on an estimated number of independent frequencies (``method='naive'``), a more careful approach based on extreme value statistics (``method='baluev'``; first explored by Baluev (2007)), and a more accurate (but computationally intensive) approach based on bootstrap resampling (``method='bootstrap'``). These methods are implemented for all of the available periodogram normalizations. Further explanation and examples are available in :ref:`stats-lombscargle`.

.. _whatsnew-3.0-python3:

Supporting only Python 3
========================

This version removed all Python 2.x compatibility code.

API, please see the :ref:`changelog`.


Renamed/removed functionality
=============================

.. _whatsnew-3.0-pytest-plugins:

pytest plugins moved to external packages
*****************************************

The following ``pytest`` plugins were previously provided as part of the
Astropy core package but have now been moved to separate packages:

* `pytest-remotedata <https://github.com/astropy/pytest-remotedata>`__
* `pytest-doctestplus <https://github.com/astropy/pytest-doctestplus>`__
* `pytest-openfiles <https://github.com/astropy/pytest-openfiles>`__

Affiliated packages that make use of one or more of these plugins may install
them individually using ``pip``, or they may install the Astropy testing
package ``pytest-astropy``, which includes all of these plugins as
dependencies. Packages that use Astropy's test runner will also need to install
``pytest-astropy``. See :ref:`testing-dependencies` for more details.

The ``config`` and ``display`` plugins are still provided as part of the
Astropy core package, but they have moved from ``astropy.tests.pytest_plugins``
to ``astropy.tests.plugins.config`` and ``astropy.tests.plugins.display``,
respectively.

Affiliated packages that currently access plugin decorators and other variables
from ``astropy.tests.pytest_plugins`` will need to make updates, although
backwards compatibility will be maintained in the meantime.

Below is an outline of the required changes:

* Affiliated packages that use the ``remote_data`` decorator to mark tests that
  require remote data access should now mark them with
  ``@pytest.mark.remote_data``. This requires installing either
  ``pytest-remotedata`` or ``pytest-astropy``. Importing ``remote_data`` from
  ``astropy.tests.helper`` is maintained for backwards compatibility but will
  eventually be removed.
* Packages should no longer import ``disable_internet`` from ``astropy.tests``.
  It is available using ``from pytest_remotedata import disable_internet`` if
  required, but developers should consider whether they can avoid importing it
  directly by instead using ``@pytest.mark.remote_data`` and
  ``@pytest.mark.internet_off`` provided by ``pytest-remotedata``.  Use of
  ``disable_internet.INTERNET_OFF`` is not recommended and should be replaced
  by use of ``remote_data`` and ``internet_off``.
* Packages that access the display configuration variables
  ``PYTEST_HEADER_MODULES`` and ``TESTED_VERSIONS`` should no longer import
  them from ``astropy.tests.pytest_plugins``. They should instead be imported
  from ``astropy.tests.plugins.display``. We hope that eventually these will be
  configurable using ``setup.cfg`` instead.
* The function ``enable_deprecations_as_exceptions`` should not be imported
  from ``astropy.tests.pytest_plugins``. It should be imported from
  ``astropy.tests.helper`` instead.
