Renamed/removed functionality
=============================

pytest plugins
**************

The following ``pytest`` plugins were previously provided as part of the
Astropy core package but have now been moved to separate packages:

* `pytest-remotedata <https://github.com/astropy/pytest-remotedata>`__
* `pytest-doctestplus <https://github.com/astropy/pytest-doctestplus>`__
* `pytest-openfiles <https://github.com/astropy/pytest-openfiles>`__

Affiliated packages that make use of one or more of these plugins may install
them individually using ``pip``, or they may install the Astropy testing
package ``pytest-astropy``, which includes all of these plugins as
dependencies. Packages that use Astropy's test runner will also need to install
``pytest-astropy``. See :ref:`testing-dependencies` for more details.

The ``config`` and ``display`` plugins are still provided as part of the
Astropy core package, but they have moved from ``astropy.tests.pytest_plugins``
to ``astropy.tests.plugins.config`` and ``astropy.tests.plugins.display``,
respectively.

Affiliated packages that currently access plugin decorators and other variables
from ``astropy.tests.pytest_plugins`` will need to make updates, although
backwards compatibility will be maintained in the meantime.

Below is an outline of the required changes:

* Affiliated packages that use the ``remote_data`` decorator to mark tests that
  require remote data access should now mark them with
  ``@pytest.mark.remote_data``. This requires installing either
  ``pytest-remotedata`` or ``pytest-astropy``. Importing ``remote_data`` from
  ``astropy.tests.helper`` is maintained for backwards compatibility but will
  eventually be removed.
* Packages should no longer import ``disable_internet`` from ``astropy.tests``.
  It is available using ``from pytest_remotedata import disable_internet`` if
  required, but developers should consider whether they can avoid importing it
  directly by instead using ``@pytest.mark.remote_data`` and
  ``@pytest.mark.internet_off`` provided by ``pytest-remotedata``.  Use of
  ``disable_internet.INTERNET_OFF`` is not recommended and should be replaced
  by use of ``remote_data`` and ``internet_off``.
* Packages that access the display configuration variables
  ``PYTEST_HEADER_MODULES`` and ``TESTED_VERSIONS`` should no longer import
  them from ``astropy.tests.pytest_plugins``. They should instead be imported
  from ``astropy.tests.plugins.display``. We hope that eventually these will be
  configurable using ``setup.cfg`` instead.
* The function ``enable_deprecations_as_exceptions`` should not be imported
  from ``astropy.tests.pytest_plugins``. It should be imported from
  ``astropy.tests.helper`` instead.
