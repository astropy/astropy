.. _whatsnew-6.1-ascii-default-int-columns-as-int64:

``io.ascii`` uses 64-integers by default for integer columns
============================================================

:mod:`~astropy.io.ascii` now uses a 64-bit integer field by
default when reading a column of integer numeric data. This changes the default behavior
on Windows and potentially 32-bit architectures. Previously on those platforms, table
columns with any long integers which overflowed the 32-bit integer would be returned
as string columns. The new default behavior is consistent with ``numpy`` v2 and ``pandas``.
