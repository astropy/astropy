What's New in Astropy 0.1
=========================

This was the initial version of Astropy, released on June 19, 2012.  It was
released primarily as a "developer preview" for developers interested in
working directly on Astropy, on affiliated packages, or on other software that
might integrate with Astropy.

Astropy 0.1 integrated several existing packages under a single ``astropy``
package with a unified installer, including:

 * asciitable as :mod:`astropy.io.ascii`
 * PyFITS as :mod:`astropy.io.fits`
 * votable as :mod:`astropy.io.vo`
 * PyWCS as :mod:`astropy.wcs`

It also added the beginnings of the :mod:`astropy.cosmology` package, and new
common data structures for science data in the :mod:`astropy.nddata` and
:mod:`astropy.table` packages.

It also laid much of the groundwork for Astropy's installation and
documentation frameworks, as well as tools for managing configuration and data
management.  These facilities are designed to be shared by Astropy's affiliated
packages in the hopes of providing a framework on which other Astronomy-related
Python packages can build.
