Fixed constructor of ``LombScargle`` class to check first element of ``t``
input for type ``Time``. This prevents a bug, where when ``t`` declared with an
array-like object, with contents of ``Time``, which seized up the
``LombScargle.power()`` and ``LombScargle.autopower()`` methods because they
expect unitless frequencies by input validation, and expect frequencies of type
``units.Quantities``, because the contents of ``t`` are of instance ``Time``.
