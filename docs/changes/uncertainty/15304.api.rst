The ``.dtype`` attribute exposed by ``Distribution`` is now that of
the samples, rather than one that has a "samples" entry.  This makes
quantities with structured data types and units easier to support, and
generally makes the ``Distribution`` appear more similar to regular
arrays.  It should have little effect on code.  For instance,
``distribution["samples"]`` still will return the actual distribution.

As a consequence of this refactoring, most arrays that are not
C-contiguous can now be viewed and will thus not be copied on input
any more.  The only exceptions are arrays for which the strides are
negative.

Note that the true data type is considered an implementation detail.
But for reference, it now is a structured data type with a single
field, "samples", which itself is an array of "sample" fields, which
contain the actual data.
