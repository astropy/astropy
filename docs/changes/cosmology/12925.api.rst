The "magic" method ``__equiv__`` now takes a new argument, tolerance, that
specifies how close two parameters must be and still considered equivalent.

Cosmology equivalence, as checked by ``Cosmology.is_equivalent``, has been
relaxed from strict parameter equality to each parameter's `numpy.dtype`'s
maximum precision, so a difference of e.g. 1e-18 for a `numpy.float64` is
considered equivalent.
