Removed deprecated module-level shim files (``astropy.cosmology.connect``,
``astropy.cosmology.core``, ``astropy.cosmology.flrw``, ``astropy.cosmology.funcs``, and
``astropy.cosmology.parameter``), which were deprecated in v7.1. All cosmology classes
and functions should be imported directly from ``astropy.cosmology``.
