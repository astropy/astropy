A new method -- ``.is_close()`` -- has been added to ``Cosmology`` to check if
the parameters in two cosmologies are close to within a specified tolerance.
The tolerance can be `None` (for strict equality), `Ellipsis` to infer the
parameter's `numpy.dtype`'s maximum precision, or a dictionary of tolerances
keyed by the parameter's name.
Like ``Cosmology.is_equivalent``, the method works on any Python object that
can be converted to a Cosmology.

A new abstract method -- ``.is_close_to_flat()`` -- has been added to
``Cosmology`` to check if a cosmology is clost to being flat. The property
``is_flat`` now calls ``is_close_to_flat``, which accepts the same tolerance
parameter as ``is_close``.
