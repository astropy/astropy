A new public module, ``astropy.cosmology.io``, has been added to provide support
for reading, writing, and converting cosmology instances.

The private modules ``astropy.cosmology.funcs``,
``astropy.cosmology.parameter``, ``astropy.cosmology.connect``,
``astropy.cosmology.core``, and ``astropy.cosmology.flrw`` have been deprecated.
Their functionality remains accessible in the `astropy.cosmology` module or in
the new ``astropy.cosmology.io`` module.
