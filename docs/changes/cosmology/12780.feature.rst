A new module ``cosmology.tests.helper`` is added to provide helper functions
when testing cosmologies and related functionality.

A new function ``cosmology_equal`` is included to check for equality between
two Cosmologies. The method accepts two keyword arguments: ``check_meta``
(default `True`) to check the metadata, in addition to the name and parameters;
and ``format`` to try to convert any object to a Cosmology before checking
equality. This works much the same as ``Cosmology.is_equivalent``.
