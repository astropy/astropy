Add method ``is_equal`` to ``Cosmology`` to check for equality between two
Cosmologies. The method accepts two keyword arguments: ``check_meta`` (default
`True`) to check the metadata, in addition to the name and parameters; and
``format`` to try to convert any object to a Cosmology before checking
equality. This works much the same as ``Cosmology.is_equivalent``.
