Flat cosmologies are now set by a mixin class, ``FlatCosmologyMixin`` and its
FLRW-specific subclass ``FlatFLRWMixin``. All ``FlatCosmologyMixin`` are flat,
but not all flat cosmologies are instances of ``FlatCosmologyMixin``. As
example, ``LambdaCDM`` **may** be flat (for the a specific set of parameter
values),  but ``FlatLambdaCDM`` **will** be flat.

Cosmology parameters are now descriptors. When accessed from a class they
transparently stores information, like the units and accepted equivalencies.
On a cosmology instance, the descriptor will return the parameter value.
Parameters can have custom ``getter`` methods.

Cosmological equality is refactored to check Parameters (and the name)
A new method, ``is_equivalent``, is added to check Cosmology equivalence, so
a ``FlatLambdaCDM`` and flat ``LambdaCDM`` are equivalent.
