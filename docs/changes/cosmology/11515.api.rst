Since cosmologies are immutable, the initialization signature and values can
be stored, greatly simplifying cloning logic and extending it to user-defined
cosmology classes that do not have attributes with the same name as each
initialization argument.
Also, the class abstraction is moved from ``FLRW`` to the base, ``Cosmology``.
