The ``physical_type`` attribute of units now returns an instance of
``astropy.units.physical.PhysicalType`` instead of a string.  Because
``PhysicalType`` instances can be compared to strings, no code changes
should be necessary when making comparisons.  The string representations
of different physical types will differ from previous releases.
