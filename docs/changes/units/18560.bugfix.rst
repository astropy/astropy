Fixed hash consistency for equivalent units. Previously, units that compared
as equal (e.g., ``u.N`` and ``u.kg * u.m / u.s**2``) could have different hash
values, violating Python's hash-equality contract. This caused issues with sets
and dictionaries where equivalent units were treated as distinct keys. Now, all
equivalent units are guaranteed to have the same hash value by using their
decomposed form for hash computation. [#18560]
