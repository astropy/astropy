Parsing deprecated units (e.g. ``u.Unit("erg", format="vounit",
parse_strict=...)``) now obeys the ``parse_strict`` argument, which has so far
been ignored in that context.
Because by default ``parse_strict="raise"`` then parsing deprecated units can
now cause an error where it previously succeeded with a warning, but the
previous behaviour (for deprecated units) can be ensured in a
backwards-compatible way by setting ``parse_strict="warn"`` explicitly.
