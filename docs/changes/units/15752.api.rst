If any iterable such as a list of tuple was input to ``Quantity``, a check was
done to see if they contained only quantities, and, if so, the quantities were
concatenated.  This makes sense for list and tuple, but is not necessarily
logical for all iterables and indeed was broken for those that do not have a
length (such as ``array_api`` array instances). Hence, the check will now be
done only for values where it makes sense, i.e., instances of list and tuple.
