Ensure that ``CompositeUnit`` always have bases consisting of named units.
A consequence of this is that decompositions into unnamed units such as
``u.ks.decompose([u.Unit("100 s")])``, while now representable, will have
different scale and bases (effectively, "1000 s" instead of "10 100 s",
where the latter could not be represented as a standard unit).

In practice, this should not affect anything, since the physical meaning of
the unit has not changed.  If the scale is important, one should use named
units (e.g., ``u.ks.decompose([u.Unit("mytime", "100 s")])``).
