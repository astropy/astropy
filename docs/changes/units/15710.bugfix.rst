Fix rare signature incompatibilities between helper and helped array functions.
Most involve cases where the corresponding numpy function has had its
arguments renamed between numpy versions. Since all those generally changed
the first arguments, which are typically passed as positional arguments,
this should not affect user code.
Affected functions:
- ``numpy.array_str``
- ``numpy.choose``
- ``numpy.convolve``
- ``numpy.correlate``
- ``numpy.histogram``
- ``numpy.histogramdd``
- ``numpy.histogram2d``
- ``numpy.isin``
- ``numpy.inner``
- ``numpy.nanmedian``
- ``numpy.unique``
- ``numpy.matrix_rank``
- ``numpy.unwrap``
- ``numpy.vdot``
- ``numpy.lib.recfunctions.unstructured_to_structured``
