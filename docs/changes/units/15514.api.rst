The following deprecated functionality has been removed:

  * ``littleh`` unit and ``with_H0`` equivalency. They are still available from
    ``cosmology.units``.
  * ``brightness_temperature`` equivalency no longer automatically swaps the
    order of its arguments if it does not match the expectation.
  * ``PhysicalType`` no longer supports ``str`` methods and attributes.
