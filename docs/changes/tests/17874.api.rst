API changes towards a future deprecation of astropy test runner:

* ``astropy.tests.runner.keyword`` is removed from public API.
  It is used internally as a decorator within astropy test runner and
  its exposure as public API was a mistake. In the future, it will be
  removed without any deprecation.
* ``astropy.tests.runner.TestRunnerBase`` and ``astropy.tests.runner.TestRunner``
  are now pending deprecation (``AstropyPendingDeprecationWarning``).
  They may start to emit ``AstropyDeprecationWarning`` in v8.0 (but no earlier).
