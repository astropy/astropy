``astropy`` v7.0.0 erroneously refused to write a VOTable if it contained units that
could not be represented in the CDS format.
Now ``astropy`` correctly chooses the unit format based on the VOTable version.
The bug in question did not cause any corruption in tables that were successfully
written because the newer VOUnit format is backwards compatible with the CDS format.
Furthermore, any unit that is in neither formats would still be written out
but would issue a warning.
