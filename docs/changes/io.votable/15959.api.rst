``Table.read(..., format='votable')``, ``votable.parse`` and
``votable.parse_single_table`` now respect the ``columns`` argument and will only output
selected columns. Previously, unselected columns would just be masked (and unallocated).
``astropy.io.votable.tree.TableElement.create_arrays`` also gained a ``colnumbers``
keyword argument to allow column selection.
