Improve performance of Binary parsing by moving converters to Cython

* **Numeric operations**: 47-57% faster
* **Mixed data types**: 37-45% faster
* **String operations**: 24-35% faster
* **Boolean fields**: 10-20% faster
* **Small overhead operations**: 29-43% faster

Performance gains are consistent across dataset sizes from 200k to 1M rows.
The most substantial improvements are seen in numeric types with up to 50-60% reduction in processing time.
