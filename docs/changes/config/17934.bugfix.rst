``get_config_dir()`` and ``get_cache_dir()`` now warn about non-existent
directories specified via ``XDG_CACHE_HOME`` and ``XDG_CONFIG_HOME`` environment
variables respectively. Missing sub-directories (i.e.
``XDG_(CACHE|CONFIG)_HOME/astropy``) will also be silently created as long as the
location is writable, and not a symbolic link.
