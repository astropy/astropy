``Time`` has switched to use ``Masked`` arrays internally, instead of
indicating masked values using NaN in the internal ``jd2`` attribute.  As a
result, any output from instances, such as one gets with, say, the ``.isot``
format, will also use ``Masked`` by default.

For backwards compatibility, a new configuration item,
``astropy.time.conf.masked_array_type`` is introduced which is set to
"astropy" by default (which indicates one wants to use ``Masked``), but can
also be set to "numpy", in which case ``numpy.ma.MaskedArray`` will be used
where possible (essentially, for all but ``Quantity``).
