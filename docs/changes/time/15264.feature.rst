Added a ``TimeDelta`` format ``quantity_str`` that represents the time delta as a string
with one or more ``Quantity`` components. This format provides a human-readable
multi-scale string representation of a time delta. The default output sub-format is not
considered stable in this release, please see https://github.com/astropy/astropy/issues/15485
for more information.
