Ensure that the ``Time`` caches of formats and scales do not get out
of sync with the actual data, even if another instance, holding a view
of the data is written to.  E.g., if one does ``t01 = t[:2]``, and
sets ``t[0]`` after, it is now guaranteed that ``t01.value`` will
correctly reflect that change in value.
