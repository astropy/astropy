``Table.pformat``'s ``max_lines`` and ``max_width`` arguments defaulting to
``None`` is now pending deprecation. In a future version of Astropy, we plan to
change their default values to -1, which gives more consistent outputs,
independent of the terminal size.

``Column.pformat``'s ``max_lines`` argument follows the same pending
deprecation.
