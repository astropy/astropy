``show_in_notebook`` method for Astropy tables has been un-deprecated and the API has
been updated to accept a ``backend`` keyword and require only keyword arguments. The new
default ``backend="ipydatagrid"`` relies on an optional dependency, ``ipydatagrid``. The
previous default table viewer (prior to Astropy 7.0) is still available as
``backend="classic"``, but it is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
