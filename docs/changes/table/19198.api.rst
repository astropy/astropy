The private ``astropy.table.np_utils`` module has been removed.  It did not
contain any code that was still used except the definition of
``TableMergeError``, which should be imported from ``astropy.table``.  All
other routines were long ago moved to either ``astropy.table.operations`` or
``astropy.utils.metadata``.
