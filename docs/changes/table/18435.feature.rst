Added generic ``from_df`` and ``to_df`` methods to ``astropy.Table`` using
``narwhals``. These methods provide a unified interface for converting between
Astropy Tables and various DataFrame formats (pandas, polars, pyarrow, etc.)
through the narwhals library. The ``to_df`` method converts an Astropy Table
to any supported DataFrame format, while ``from_df`` creates an Astropy Table
from any narwhals-compatible DataFrame. Narwhals is a lightweight compatibility
layer that provides a unified API across different DataFrame libraries, allowing
seamless interoperability without requiring all DataFrame libraries as dependencies.
