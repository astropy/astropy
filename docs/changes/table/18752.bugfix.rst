Fix a bug where the ECSV writer was not correctly quoting column names if the first name
starts with the "#" character or any names contain leading/trailing whitespace. In this
situation, all column names are now surrounded by double quotes per the ECSV standard.
Likewise the ECSV reader was incorrectly stripping surrounding whitespace from column
names, leading to a consistency check failure when reading.
