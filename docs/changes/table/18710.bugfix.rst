Fixed a bug where reading an ECSV file with a column name starting with ``#``
would raise an ``InconsistentTableError``. The fix includes two improvements:
(1) The ECSV reader's comment regex now correctly requires a space after ``#``
per the ECSV specification, preventing column names like ``#col`` from being
treated as comment lines. (2) The ECSV writer now quotes column names that
start with ``#`` to prevent any ambiguity. This ensures that tables with such
column names can be successfully written and read back. [#18710]
