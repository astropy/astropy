Fix a bug when slicing a table that has a multi-column index. Previously, after slicing
the table then ``tbl.indices`` would show duplicates of the multi-column index, one for
each column in the index. The underlying indices on the index columns were incorrectly
distinct objects instead of the expected reference to a single index object.
