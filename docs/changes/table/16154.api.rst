``TableColumns.setdefault()``  and ``TableColumns.update()`` methods (which
would typically be called as ``Table.columns.setdefault()`` and
``Table.columns.update()``) have been deprecated because they can easily
corrupt the ``Table`` instance the ``TableColumns`` instance is attached to.
The ``Table.setdefault()`` and ``Table.update()`` methods are safe.
