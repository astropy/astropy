Selecting a table index in the ``.loc``, ``.iloc``, or ``.loc_indices`` properties by
passing the index identifier as the first element of the item is deprecated and is
planned for removal in astropy 9.0. For example, if a table ``t`` has two indices on
columns ``"a"`` and ``"b"`` respectively, then ``t.loc["b", 2]`` (to find table rows
where ``t["b"] == 2``) is deprecated. This is replaced by ``t.loc.with_index("b")[2]``.
