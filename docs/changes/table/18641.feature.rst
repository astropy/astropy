Setting the ``units`` or ``descriptions`` of ``QTable`` and ``Table``
has been made more flexible for tables with optional columns that may
or may not appear in the data. This applies to directly creating a table
as well as reading formatted data with the ``read()`` method.

In both cases you can supply ``units`` and ``description`` arguments as a
``dict`` that specifies the units and descriptions for column names in
the table. Previously, if the input table did not contain a column that
was specified in the ``units`` or ``description`` dict, a ``ValueError``
was raised. Now, such columns are simply ignored.
