The ``read()`` methods of ``QTable`` and ``Table`` have been made more
flexible when reading tables with optional columns that may or may not
appear in the data. 

These methods accept ``units`` and ``description`` arguments as a
``dict`` that specifies the units and descriptions for column names in
the table. Previously, if the input table did not contain a column that
was specified in the ``units`` or ``description`` dict, a
``ValueError`` was raised. Now, such columns are simply ignored.
