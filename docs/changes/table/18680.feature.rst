A new method has been added for accessing a table index for tables with multiple
indices. You can now select the index with the ``with_index(index_id)`` method of the
``.loc``, ``.iloc``, and ``.loc_indices`` properties. For example, for a table ``t``
which has two indices on columns ``"a"`` and ``"b"`` respectively,
``t.loc.with_index("b")[2]`` will use index ``"b"`` to find all the table rows where
``t["b"] == 2``. Doing this query using the previous syntax ``t.loc["b", 2]`` is
deprecated and this functionality is planned for removal in astropy 9.0.

In addition, support has been added for using ``.loc``, ``.iloc``, and ``.loc_indices``
with an index based on two or more key columns. Previously this raised a ``ValueError``.
