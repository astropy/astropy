``BaseCoordinateFrame`` instances now have a ``frame`` property that returns
the frame instance itself.
This can be useful for any code that extracts the coordinate data from a
``SkyCoord`` by accessing its ``frame`` attribute because such code can now
treat ``SkyCoord`` and ``BaseCoordinateFrame`` instances in a uniform manner.
