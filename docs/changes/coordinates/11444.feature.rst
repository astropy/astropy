All representations now have a ``transform`` method, which allows them to be
transformed by a 3x3 matrix in a Cartesian basis. By default, transformations
are routed through ``CartesianRepresentation``. ``SphericalRepresentation`` and
``PhysicssphericalRepresentation`` override this for speed and to prevent NaN
leakage from the distance to the angular components.
Also, the functions ``is_O3`` and ``is_rotation`` have been added to
``matrix_utities`` for checking whether a matrix is in the O(3) group or is a
rotation (proper or improper), respectively.
