All representations now have a ``transform`` method, which allows them to be
transformed by a 3x3 matrix in a Cartesian basis. By default, transformations
are routed through ``CartesianRepresentation``. ``SphericalRepresentation`` and
``PhysicssphericalRepresentation`` override this for speed and to prevent NaN
leakage from the distance to the angular components.
Also, add a utility function in ``matrix_utities`` to check whether a matrix is
a rotation  (proper or improper).
