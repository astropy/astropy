Representations now interact properly with ``Masked`` underlying data,
combining their masks in a new ``.mask`` property. One can also check whether
the data are masked using ``.masked`` and get an unmasked version out via
``.unmasked``. In general, the procedure is similar to that of ``Time``,
except that the mask is not shared between all components, to enable holding,
e.g., a catalogue of objects in which only some have associated distances.
