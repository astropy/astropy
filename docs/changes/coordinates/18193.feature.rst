Allow ``np.concatenate``, ``np.stack`` and similar numpy functions to
be applied on representations and differentials.

They can also be applied to coordinate frames and ``SkyCoord``, though
with the same limitation as for setting elements of frames and
coordinates: all frame attributes have to be scalars (or arrays with
only identical elements).
