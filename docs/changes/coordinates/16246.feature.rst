By default the ``SkyCoord`` and ``BaseCoordinateFrame`` ``separation()``
methods now emit a warning if they have to perform a coordinate transformation
that is not a pure rotation to inform the user that the angular separation can
depend on the direction of the transformation.
It is possible to modify this behaviour with the new optional keyword-only
``origin_mismatch`` argument.
Specifying ``origin_mismatch="ignore"`` allows any transformation to
succeed without warning, which has been the behaviour so far.
``origin_mismatch="error"`` forbids all transformations that are not
pure rotations.
