``astropy`` prefers reading data required for ``EarthLocation.of_site()`` from
a local cache and tries downloading (and caching) the data from the Internet if
the cache is empty.
As a last resort ``astropy`` has so far read a small bundled data file that
provided data for Greenwich as the single entry, but now ``astropy`` will raise
an error.
