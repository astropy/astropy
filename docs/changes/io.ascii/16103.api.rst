The parallel fast-reader parser for reading ASCII files has been removed.
Since astropy v4.0.4 requesting this option has issued a warning that
this option is broken and that the serial parser will be used.
The ``parallel`` key in the ``fast_reader`` argument for reading
ASCII tables is no longer available.
