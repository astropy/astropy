The performance of guessing the table format when reading large files with
``astropy.io.ascii`` has been improved. Now the process uses at most
10000 lines of the file to check if it matches the format. This behavior can
be configured using the ``astropy.io.ascii.conf.guess_limit_lines``
configuration item, including disabling the limit entirely.
