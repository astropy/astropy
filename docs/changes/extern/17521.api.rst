Astropy used to bundle the javascript libraries jQuery and DataTables for
interactive (e.g. sorting by column values) tables using the ``show_in_browser()``
method.
This bundling requires relatively large files in astropy itself, for a relatively minor feature.
Furthermore, the astropy developers are not experts in javascript development, and
javascript libraries many need updates to improve on security vulnerabilities.
This change removes the bundled versions of jQuery and DataTables from astropy,
updates the default version of the remote URLs to version 2.1.8 of DataTables, and
sets the default for ``show_in_browser(use_local_files=False)`` to use the remote versions
in all cases. If the method is called with ``use_local_files=True``, a warning is
displayed and remote version are used anyway.
This may break the use of the method when working offline, unless the javascript
files are cached by the browser from a previous online session.
