Two new classes -- ``JSONExtendedEncoder`` and ``JSONExtendedDecoder` -- have
been added to extend support for data types that Python's default JSON does not
support. Unsupported data types can be registered with the classes using a
registry system, including via entry points.

All python builtins, essential numpy classes, and many astropy objects come
pre-registered. This includes (but is not limited to):

- builtins: ``bytes``, ``complex``, ``set``, ``NotImplemented``, ``Ellipsis``
- numpy: ``numpy.array``, ``numpy.number``, ``numpy.dtype``
- Astropy:
    - ``Unit`` and related classes, ``Quantity`` and subclasses
    - ``Cosmology`` and subclasses
