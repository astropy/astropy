Fix loading parser tabs on pyc-only installations.

Fix a bug in the wrappers for the lex and yacc wrappers that are
used for parsing Astropy units so that they work on pyc-only
installations.

According to the Python module loading
`flow chart <https://peps.python.org/pep-3147/#flow-chart>`_, when evaluating
``import foo`` and ``foo.py`` is not found, Python then reads ``foo.pyc``.

One can take advantage of this fact to strip source files and leave only Python
bytecode files for deployment inspace-constrained execution environments such
as AWS Lambda. Astropy is now compatible with pyc-only deployments.
