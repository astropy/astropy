Fix for ``fsspec`` configuration in ``fits.open`` for remote S3 objects. ``fits.open``
now accepts the keyword argument ``filesystem_kwargs``, which is passed onto
``fsspec.filesystem`` for configuring, e.g., the buffer block size. Remote FITS
file objects are then opened with ``fsspec.filesystem.open``.
