Changed the behaviour of two warnings within ``FITSWCSAPIMixin`` related to ``.SpectralCoord``.
They have been changed to emit debug messages within the logger.

These are, "observer cannot be converted to ICRS, so will not be set on SpectralCoord"
and "target cannot be converted to ICRS, so will not be set on SpectralCoord".
