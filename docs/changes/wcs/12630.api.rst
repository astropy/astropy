The ``pixel`` argument to ``astropy.visualization.wcsaxes.ticklabels.TickLabels.add``
no longer does anything, is deprecated, and will be removed in a future
astropy version. It has been replaced by a new required ``data`` argument, which
should be used to specify the data coordinates of the tick label being added.

This changes has been made because it is (in general) not possible to correctly
calculate pixel coordinates before Matplotlib is drawing a figure.
