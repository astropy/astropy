``wcs.high_level_objects_to_values`` and ``wcs.values_to_high_level_objects``
now accept two new optional parameters - ``object_classes`` and ``object_components``, which are the
``world_axis_object_classes`` and ``world_axis_object_components`` for a specific coordinate
frame in the WCS pipeline. This change applies mostly to GWCS.
