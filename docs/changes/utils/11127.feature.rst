``astropy.utils.masked`` provides a new ``Masked`` class/factory that can be
used to represent masked ``ndarray`` and all its subclasses, including
``Quantity`` and its subclasses.  These classes can be used inside
coordinates, but the mask is not yet exposed.  Generally, the interface should
be considered experimental.
