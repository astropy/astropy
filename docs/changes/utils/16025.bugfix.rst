Fix rare signature incompatibilities between helper and helped array functions.
These typically cover corner cases and should not affect user code.
Some arguments weren't being re-exposed correctly or at all, depending on
numpy's version.
Affected functions:
- ``numpy.broadcast_arrays``
- ``numpy.median``
- ``numpy.quantile``
- ``numpy.empty_like``
- ``numpy.ones_like``
- ``numpy.zeros_like``
- ``numpy.full_like``
