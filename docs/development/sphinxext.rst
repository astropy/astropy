Sphinx extensions
=================

This page gives the API for the custom Sphinx extensions used in Astropy.

automodapi Extension
--------------------

.. automodule:: astropy.sphinx.ext.automodapi

.. automodsumm:: astropy.sphinx.ext.automodapi
    :toctree: ../_generated/



Numpydoc Extension
------------------

This extension is a port of the
`numpydoc <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/numpydoc/0.3.1>`_ extentension written by
the `numpy <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`_ and `scipy <http://scipy.org/>`_
projects, with some tweaks for Astropy.  See the code for details, as it
is quite complex and includes a variety of interrelated extensions.
