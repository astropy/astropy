Contributing to Astropy
***********************

So you are interested in contributing to the Astropy Project?  Excellent! We
love contributions! Astropy is open source, built on open source, and we'd
love to have in our community.

For the time being, please see our `CONTRIBUTING.md
<https://github.com/astropy/astropy/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_ document
for an overview of ways you can contribute to Astropy.  The rest of this
document is focused specifically on documentation for contributors and
maintainers on how to work the Astropy repository for submitting
documentation and code changes.

For the guiding vision of this process and the project
as a whole, see :doc:`development/vision`.
