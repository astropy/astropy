Cosmological Calculations (`astropy.cosmology`)
***********************************************

Introduction
============

The `astropy.cosmology` subpackage contains classes for representing
cosmologies, and utility functions for calculating commonly used
quantities that depend on a cosmological model. This includes
distances, ages and lookback times corresponding to a measured
redshift or the transverse separation corresponding to a measured
angular separation.


Getting Started
===============

There are many functions available to calculate cosmological quantities.
They generally take a redshift as input. For example, the two cases
below give you the value of the Hubble constant at z=0 (i.e., `H0`), and
the number of transverse proper kpc corresponding to an arcminute at z=3:

  >>> from astropy import cosmology
  >>> cosmology.H(0)
  <Quantity 69.32 km / (Mpc s)>
  >>> cosmology.kpc_proper_per_arcmin(3)  # doctest: +REQUIRES_SCIPY
  <Quantity 472.977096... kpc / arcmin>

All the functions available are listed in the `Reference/API`_
section. These will use the "current" cosmology to calculate the
values (see `The Current Cosmology`_ section below for more
details). If you haven't set this explicitly, they will use the 9-year
WMAP cosmological parameters and print a warning message.

Also note that the cosmology subpackage makes use of `~astropy.units`, so
in many cases returns values with units attached -- consult the documentation
for that subpackage for more details, but, briefly, to access the floating
point (or array) values:

  >>> from astropy import cosmology
  >>> H0 = cosmology.H(0)
  >>> H0.value, H0.unit
  (69.32, Unit("km / (Mpc s)"))

There are also several standard cosmologies already defined, as
described in `Built-in Cosmologies`_ below. These are objects
with methods and attributes that calculate cosmological
values. For example, the comoving distance in Mpc to redshift 4 using
the 5-year WMAP parameters:

  >>> from astropy.cosmology import WMAP5
  >>> WMAP5.comoving_distance(4)  # doctest: +REQUIRES_SCIPY
  <Quantity 7329.328093495547 Mpc>

An important point is that the cosmological parameters of each
instance are immutable -- that is, if you want to change, say,
`Om`, you need to make a new instance of the class.  Also note that
the built in cosmologies are instances of classes as described below,
not functions.

Using `cosmology`
=================

Most of the functionality is enabled by the
`~astropy.cosmology.core.FLRW` object. This represents a
homogeneous and isotropic cosmology (a cosmology characterized by the
Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric, named after the people who
solved Einstein's field equation for this special case).  However,
you can't work with this class directly, as you must specify a
dark energy model by using one of its subclasses instead,
such as `~astropy.cosmology.core.FlatLambdaCDM`.

You can create a new `~astropy.cosmology.core.FlatLambdaCDM` object with
arguments giving the Hubble parameter and omega matter (both at z=0):

  >>> from astropy.cosmology import FlatLambdaCDM
  >>> cosmo = FlatLambdaCDM(H0=70, Om0=0.3)
  >>> # FIXME: TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable
  >>> cosmo  # doctest: +SKIP
  FlatLambdaCDM(H0=70 km / (Mpc s), Om0=0.3, Tcmb0=2.725 K,
                Neff=3.04, m_nu=[ 0.  0.  0.] eV)

This can also be done more explicity using units, which is recommended:

  >>> from astropy.cosmology import FlatLambdaCDM
  >>> import astropy.units as u
  >>> cosmo = FlatLambdaCDM(H0=70 * u.km / u.s / u.Mpc, Om0=0.3)

However, most of the parameters that accept units (`H0`, `Tcmb0`)
have default units, so unit quantities do not have to be used.
The exception are neutrino masses, where you must supply a
units if you want massive neutrinos.

The pre-defined cosmologies described in the `Getting Started`_
section are instances of `~astropy.cosmology.core.FlatLambdaCDM`, and have
the same methods. So we can find the luminosity distance to
redshift 4 by:

  >>> cosmo.luminosity_distance(4)  # doctest: +REQUIRES_SCIPY
  <Quantity 35842.353618623194 Mpc>

or the age of the universe at z = 0:

  >>> cosmo.age(0)  # doctest: +REQUIRES_SCIPY
  <Quantity 13.461701658024014 Gyr>

They also accept arrays of redshifts:

  >>> cosmo.age([0.5, 1, 1.5]).value  # doctest: +REQUIRES_SCIPY
  array([ 8.42128047,  5.74698053,  4.19645402])

See the `~astropy.cosmology.core.FLRW` and
`~astropy.cosmology.core.FlatLambdaCDM` object docstring for all the
methods and attributes available. In addition to flat Universes,
non-flat varieties are supported such as
`~astropy.cosmology.core.LambdaCDM`.  There are also a variety of
standard cosmologies with the parameters already defined
(see `Built-in Cosmologies`_):

  >>> from astropy.cosmology import WMAP7   # WMAP 7-year cosmology
  >>> WMAP7.critical_density(0)       # critical density at z = 0
  <Quantity 9.31000324...e-30 g / cm3>

You can see how the density parameters evolve with redshift as well

  >>> from astropy.cosmology import WMAP7   # WMAP 7-year cosmology
  >>> WMAP7.Om([0, 1.0, 2.0]), WMAP7.Ode([0., 1.0, 2.0])
  (array([ 0.272      ,  0.748985...,  0.909052...]),
   array([ 0.727915...,  0.250550...,  0.090102...]))

Note that these don't quite add up to one even though WMAP7 assumes a
flat Universe because photons and neutrinos are included, and that
they are not `~astropy.units.Quantity` objects because they are dimensionless.

Cosmological instances have an optional ``name`` attribute which can be
descriptive:

  >>> from astropy.cosmology import FlatwCDM
  >>> cosmo = FlatwCDM(name='SNLS3+WMAP7', H0=71.58, Om0=0.262, w0=-1.016)
  >>> cosmo
  FlatwCDM(name="SNLS3+WMAP7", H0=71.6 km / (Mpc s), Om0=0.262,
           w0=-1.02, Tcmb0=2.725 K, Neff=3.04, m_nu=[ 0.  0.  0.] eV)

This is also an example of a model with a different model for dark
energy, a flat Universe with a constant dark energy equation of state,
but not necessarily a cosmological constant.  A variety of additional
dark energy models are also supported -- see `Specifying a dark energy model`_.

In addition to the `~astropy.cosmology.core.LambdaCDM` object, there
are convenience functions that calculate some of these quantities
without needing to explicitly give a cosmology - but there are more
methods available if you work directly with the cosmology object.

  >>> from astropy import cosmology
  >>> cosmology.kpc_proper_per_arcmin(3)  # doctest: +REQUIRES_SCIPY
  <Quantity 472.977096... kpc / arcmin>
  >>> cosmology.arcsec_per_kpc_proper(3)  # doctest: +REQUIRES_SCIPY
  <Quantity 0.126856... arcsec / kpc>

These functions will perform calculations using the "current"
cosmology. This is a specific cosmology that is currently active in
`astropy` and it's described further in the following section. They
can also be explicitly given a cosmology using the `cosmo` keyword
argument. A full list of convenience functions is included below, in
the `Reference/API`_ section.

The Current Cosmology
---------------------

Sometimes it's useful for Astropy functions to assume a default
cosmology so that the desired cosmology doesn't have to be specified
every time the function is called -- the convenience functions
described in the previous section are one example. For these cases
it's possible to specify a "current" cosmology.

You can set the current cosmology to a pre-defined value by using the
"default_cosmology" option in the ``[cosmology.core]`` section of the
configuration file (see :ref:`astropy_config`). Alternatively, you can
use the `~astropy.cosmology.core.set_current` function to set a
cosmology for the current Python session.

If you haven't set a current cosmology using one of the methods
described above, then the cosmology module will use the 9-year WMAP
parameters and print a warning message letting you know this. For
example, if you call a convenience function without setting the
current cosmology or using the `cosmo=` keyword you see the following
message:

  >>> from astropy import cosmology
  >>> cosmology.lookback_time(1)  # lookback time in Gyr at z=1  # doctest: +REQUIRES_SCIPY
  <Quantity 7.846670... Gyr>

The 9-year WMAP and Planck 2013 cosmologies are also available

  >>> from astropy.cosmology import WMAP9   # WMAP 9-year
  >>> WMAP9.lookback_time(2).value          # lookback time in Gyr at z=2  # doctest: +REQUIRES_SCIPY
  10.442114...
  >>> from astropy.cosmology import Planck13  # Planck 2013
  >>> Planck13.lookback_time(2)             # lookback time in Gyr at z=2  # doctest: +REQUIRES_SCIPY
  <Quantity 10.511841... Gyr>

.. note::

    In general it's better to use an explicit cosmology (for example
    ``WMAP9.H(0)`` instead of ``cosmology.H(0)``). The motivation for
    this is that when you go back to use the code at a later date or
    share your scripts with someone else, the default cosmology may
    have changed. Use of the convenience functions should generally be
    reserved for interactive work or cases where the flexibility of
    quickly changing between different cosmologies is for some reason
    useful. Alternatively, putting (for example)
    ``cosmology.set_current(WMAP9)`` at the top of your code will
    ensure that the right cosmology is always used.

Built-in Cosmologies
--------------------

A number of pre-loaded cosmologies are available from the
WMAP and Planck satellites.  For example,

  >>> from astropy.cosmology import Planck13  # Planck 2013
  >>> Planck13.luminosity_distance(2)         # luminosity distance to z=2  # doctest: +REQUIRES_SCIPY
  <Quantity 15932.668054... Mpc>

A full list of the pre-defined cosmologies is given by
`cosmology.parameters.available`, and summarized below:

========  ============================= ====  ===== =======
Name      Source                        H0    Om    Flat
========  ============================= ====  ===== =======
WMAP5     Komatsu et al. 2009           70.2  0.277 Yes
WMAP7     Komatsu et al. 2011           70.4  0.272 Yes
WMAP9     Hinshaw et al. 2013           69.3  0.287 Yes
Planck13  Planck Collab 2013, Paper XVI 67.8  0.307 Yes
========  ============================= ====  ===== =======

Currently, all are instances of `~astropy.cosmology.core.FlatLambdaCDM`.
More details about exactly where each set of parameters come from
are available in the document tag for each object:

  >>> from astropy.cosmology import WMAP7
  >>> print(WMAP7.__doc__)
  WMAP7 instance of FlatLambdaCDM cosmology
  (from Komatsu et al. 2011, ApJS, 192, 18, doi: 10.1088/0067-0049/192/2/18.
  Table 1 (WMAP + BAO + H0 ML).)

Using `cosmology` inside Astropy
--------------------------------

If you are writing code for the `astropy` core or an affiliated
package, it is strongly recommended that you use the current cosmology
through the `~astropy.cosmology.core.get_current` function. It is also
recommended that you provide an override option something like the
following::

    def myfunc(..., cosmo=None):
	from astropy.cosmology import get_current

	if cosmo is None:
	    cosmo = get_current()

	... your code here ...

This ensures that all code consistently uses the current cosmology
unless explicitly overridden.

Specifying a dark energy model
==============================

In addition to the standard `~astropy.cosmology.core.FlatLambdaCDM` model
described above, a number of additional dark energy models are
provided.  `~astropy.cosmology.core.FlatLambdaCDM`
and `~astropy.cosmology.core.LambdaCDM` assume that dark
energy is a cosmological constant, and should be the most commonly
used cases; the former assumes a flat Universe, the latter allows
for spatial curvature.  `~astropy.cosmology.core.FlatwCDM` and
`~astropy.cosmology.core.wCDM` assum a constant dark
energy equation of state parameterized by :math:`w_{0}`. Two forms of a
variable dark energy equation of state are provided: the simple first
order linear expansion :math:`w(z) = w_{0} + w_{z} z` by
`~astropy.cosmology.core.w0wzCDM`, as well as the common CPL form by
`~astropy.cosmology.core.w0waCDM`: :math:`w(z) = w_{0} + w_{a} (1 - a) =
w_{0} + w_{a} z / (1 + z)` and its generalization to include a pivot
redshift by `~astropy.cosmology.core.wpwaCDM`: :math:`w(z) = w_{p} + w_{a}
(a_{p} - a)`.

Users can specify their own equation of state by sub-classing
`~astropy.cosmology.core.FLRW`.  See the provided subclasses for
examples.

Photons and Neutrinos
=====================
The cosmology classes include the contribution to the energy density
from both photons and neutrinos.  By default, the latter are assumed
massless.  The three parameters controlling the proporties of these
species, which are arguments to the initializers of all the
cosmological classes, are `Tcmb0` (the temperature of the CMB at z=0),
`Neff`, the effective number of neutrino species, and `m_nu`, the rest
mass of the neutrino species.  `Tcmb0` and `m_nu` should be expressed
as unit Quantities.  All three have standard default values (2.725 K,
3.04, and 0 eV respectively; the reason that `Neff` is not 3 primarily
has to do with a small bump in the neutrino energy spectrum due to
electron-positron annihilation, but is also affected by weak
interaction physics).

Massive neutrinos are treated using the approach described in the
WMAP 7-year cosmology paper (Komatsu et al. 2011, ApJS, 192, 18, section 3.3).
This is not the simple
:math:`\Omega_{\nu 0} h^2 = \sum_i m_{\nu\, i} / 93.04\,\mathrm{eV}`
approximation.  Also note that the values of :math:`\Omega_{\nu}(z)`
include both the kinetic energy and the rest-mass energy components,
and that the Planck13 cosmology includes a single species of neutrinos
with non-zero mass (which is not included in :math:`\Omega_{m0}`).

The contribution of photons and neutrinos to the total mass-energy density
can be found as a function of redshift:

  >>> from astropy.cosmology import WMAP7   # WMAP 7-year cosmology
  >>> WMAP7.Ogamma0, WMAP7.Onu0 # Current epoch values
  (4.985694...e-05, 3.442154...e-05)
  >>> z = [0, 1.0, 2.0]
  >>> WMAP7.Ogamma(z), WMAP7.Onu(z)
  (array([  4.985694...e-05,   2.745744...e-04,   4.998813...e-04]),
   array([  3.442154...e-05,   1.895678...e-04,   3.451212...e-04]))

If you want to exclude photons and neutrinos from your calculations,
simply set `Tcmb0` to 0:

  >>> from astropy.cosmology import FlatLambdaCDM
  >>> import astropy.units as u
  >>> cos = FlatLambdaCDM(70.4 * u.km / u.s / u.Mpc, 0.272, Tcmb0 = 0.0 * u.K)
  >>> cos.Ogamma0, cos.Onu0
  (0.0, 0.0)

Neutrinos can be removed (while leaving photons) by setting `Neff` to 0:

  >>> from astropy.cosmology import FlatLambdaCDM
  >>> cos = FlatLambdaCDM(70.4, 0.272, Neff=0)
  >>> cos.Ogamma([0,1,2]), cos.Onu([0,1,2])
  (array([  4.98569497e-05,   2.74623215e-04,   5.00051839e-04]),
   array([0, 0, 0]))

The number of neutrino species is assumed to be the floor of `Neff`,
which in the default case is 3.  Therefore, if non-zero neutrino masses
are desired, then 3 masses should be provided.  However, if only one
value is provided, all the species are assumed to have the same mass.
`Neff` is assumed to be shared equally between each species.

  >>> from astropy.cosmology import FlatLambdaCDM
  >>> import astropy.units as u
  >>> H0 = 70.4 * u.km / u.s / u.Mpc
  >>> m_nu = 0 * u.eV
  >>> cos = FlatLambdaCDM(H0, 0.272, m_nu=m_nu)
  >>> cos.has_massive_nu
  False
  >>> cos.m_nu
  <Quantity [ 0., 0., 0.] eV>
  >>> m_nu = [0.0, 0.05, 0.10] * u.eV
  >>> cos = FlatLambdaCDM(H0, 0.272, m_nu=m_nu)
  >>> cos.has_massive_nu
  True
  >>> cos.m_nu
  <Quantity [ 0.  , 0.05, 0.1 ] eV>
  >>> cos.Onu([0, 1.0, 15.0])
  array([ 0.00326988,  0.00896783,  0.0125786 ])
  >>> cos.Onu(1) * cos.critical_density(1)
  <Quantity 2.444380380370406e-31 g / cm3>

While these examples used `~astropy.cosmology.core.FlatLambdaCDM`,
the above examples also apply for all of the other cosmology classes.

Range of validity and reliability
=================================

The code in this sub-package is tested against several widely-used
online cosmology calculators, and has been used to perform
calculations in refereed papers. You can check the range of redshifts
over which the code is regularly tested in the module
`astropy.cosmology.tests.test_cosmology`. If you find any bugs, please
let us know by `opening an issue at the github repository
<https://github.com/astropy/astropy/issues>`_!

The built in cosmologies use the parameters as listed in the
respective papers.  These provide only a limited range of precision,
and so you should not expect derived quantities to match beyond
that precision.  For example, the Planck 2013 results only provide the
Hubble constant to 4 digits.  Therefore, the Planck13 built-in
cosmology should only be expected to match the age of the Universe
quoted by the Planck team to 4 digits, although they provide 5 in the paper.
