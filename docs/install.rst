Installation
============

Requirements
------------

Astropy has the following strict requirements:

- `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ 2.6, 2.7, 3.1 or 3.2

- `Numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_ 1.4 or later

Astropy also depends on other projects for optional features.

- `xmllint <http://www.xmlsoft.org/>`_: To validate VOTABLE XML files.

TODO: Link to the planned dependency checker/installer tool.

Installing Astropy
------------------

Using `pip`
```````````

TODO: Write once weâ€™re up on PyPI.

Binary installers
`````````````````

TODO: Write about where to obtain binary packages (.dmg, .msi etc.)

Building from source
--------------------

Prerequisites
`````````````

You will need a compiler suite and the development headers for Python
and Numpy in order to build Astropy.  Using the package manager for
your platform will usually be the easiest route.

The `instructions for building Numpy from source
<http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/install.html>`_ are also a good
resource for setting up your environment to build Python packages.

Obtaining the source
````````````````````

Source packages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Source tarballs of past releases and the current development branch of
astropy can be downloaded from here:

   https://github.com/astropy/astropy/downloads

Development repository
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The latest development version of Astropy can be cloned from github
using this command::

   git clone git://github.com/astropy/astropy.git

.. note::

   If you wish to participate in the development of Astropy, see
   :ref:`developer-docs`.  This document covers only the basics
   necessary to install Astropy.

Building and Installing
```````````````````````

Astropy uses the Python `distutils framework
<http://docs.python.org/install/index.html>`_ for building and
installing.

To build Astropy (from the root of the source tree)::

    python setup.py build

To install Astropy (from the root of the source tree)::

    python setup.py install

Building documentation
``````````````````````

Building the documentation requires some additional packages:

    - `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org>`_ (and its dependencies) 1.0 or later

    - `Graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org>`_

To build the Astropy documentation (from the root of the source tree)::

    python setup.py build_sphinx

The documentation tree will be built in the `docs/_build/html`
directory.

Testing Astropy
```````````````

The easiest way to test that your Astropy built correctly is to run
(from the root of the source tree)::

    python setup.py test

There are also alternative methods of :ref:`running-tests`.
