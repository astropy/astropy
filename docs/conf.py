# Astropy documentation build configuration file, created by
# sphinx-quickstart on Tue Jul 26 02:59:34 2011.
#
# This file is execfile()d with the current directory set to its containing dir.
#
# Note that not all possible configuration values are present in this
# autogenerated file.
#
# All configuration values have a default; values that are commented out
# serve to show the default.

#some of the docs require the autodoc special-members option, in 1.1
needs_sphinx = '1.1'

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.
# sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('..'))
# IMPORTANT: the above commented section was generated by sphinx-quickstart, but
# is *NOT* appropriate for astropy or Astropy affiliated packages. It is left
# commented oout with this explanation to make it clear why this should not be
# done. If the sys.path entry above is added, when the astropy.sphinx.conf
# import occurs, it will import the *source* version of astropy instead of the
# version installed (if invoked as "make html" or directly with sphinx), or the
# version in the build directory (if " pythonsetup.py build_sphinx" is used).
# Thus, any C-extensions that are needed to build the documentation will *not*
# be accessible, and the documentation will not build correctly.

# Load all of the global Astropy configuration
from astropy.sphinx.conf import *

# The intersphinx_mapping in astropy.sphinx.conf refers to astropy for
# the benefit of affiliated packages who want to refer to objeects in
# the astropy core.  However, we don't want to cyclically reference
# astropy in its own build so we remove it here.
