# Astropy documentation build configuration file.
#
# This file is execfile()d with the current directory set to its containing dir.
#
# Note that not all possible configuration values are present in this file.
#
# All configuration values have a default. Some values are defined in
# the global Astropy configuration which is loaded here before anything else.
# See astropy.sphinx.conf for which values are set there.

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.
# sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('..'))
# IMPORTANT: the above commented section was generated by sphinx-quickstart, but
# is *NOT* appropriate for astropy or Astropy affiliated packages. It is left
# commented out with this explanation to make it clear why this should not be
# done. If the sys.path entry above is added, when the astropy.sphinx.conf
# import occurs, it will import the *source* version of astropy instead of the
# version installed (if invoked as "make html" or directly with sphinx), or the
# version in the build directory (if "python setup.py build_sphinx" is used).
# Thus, any C-extensions that are needed to build the documentation will *not*
# be accessible, and the documentation will not build correctly.

# the astropy core.  However, we don't want to cyclically reference
# astropy in its own build so we remove it here.

# A NOTE ON HTML THEMES
#
# The global astropy configuration uses a custom theme,
# 'bootstrap-astropy', which is installed along with astropy. The
# theme has options for controlling the text of the logo in the upper
# left corner. This is how you would specify the options in order to
# override the theme defaults (The following options *are* the
# defaults, so we do not actually need to set them here.)

#    'logotext2': 'py',     # orange, light
#    'logotext3': ':docs'   # white,  light
#    }

# A different theme can be used, or other parts of this theme can be
# modified, by overriding some of the variables set in the global
# configuration. The variables set in the global configuration are
# listed below, commented out.

# To use a different custom theme, add the directory containing the theme.

# a list of builtin themes. To override the custom theme, set this to the
# name of a builtin theme or the name of a custom theme in html_theme_path.

# docs.  This file should be a Windows icon file (.ico) being 16x16 or 32x32
# pixels large.

# If not '', a 'Last updated on:' timestamp is inserted at every page bottom,
