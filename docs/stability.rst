******************************
Current status of sub-packages
******************************

Astropy has benefited from the addition of widely tested legacy code, as well
as new development, resulting in variations in stability across
sub-packages. This document summarizes the current status of the Astropy
sub-packages, so that users understand where they might expect changes in
future, and which sub-packages they can safely use for production code.

Note that until version 1.0, even sub-packages considered *Mature* could
undergo some user interface changes as we work to integrate the packages
better. Thus, we cannot guarantee complete backward-compatibility between
versions at this stage.
