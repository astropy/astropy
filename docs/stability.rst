******************************
Current status of sub-packages
******************************

Astropy has benefited from the addition of widely tested legacy code, as well
as new development, resulting in variations in stability across
sub-packages. This document summarizes the current status of the Astropy
sub-packages, so that users understand where they might expect changes in
future, and which sub-packages they can safely use for production code.

The classification is as follows:

.. raw:: html

    <style>
         .planned:before {
              color: #cbcbcb;
              content: "⬤";
         }
         .dev:before {
              color: #ffad00;
              content: "⬤";
         }
         .stable:before {
              color: #4e72c3;
              content: "⬤";
         }
         .mature:before {
              color: #03a913;
              content: "⬤";
         }
         .pendingdep:before {

              content: "⬤";
         }
         .deprecated:before {

              content: "⬤";
         }
    </style>
