Miscellaneous: HDF5, YAML, ASDF, Parquet, pickle (`astropy.io.misc`)
********************************************************************

The `astropy.io.misc` module contains miscellaneous input/output routines that
do not fit elsewhere, and are often used by other ``astropy`` sub-packages. For
example, `astropy.io.misc.hdf5` contains functions to read/write
:class:`~astropy.table.Table` objects from/to HDF5 files, but these
should not be imported directly by users. Instead, users can access this
functionality via the :class:`~astropy.table.Table` class itself (see
:ref:`table_io`). Routines that are intended to be used directly by users are
listed in the `astropy.io.misc` section.

astropy.io.misc.asdf Package
============================

The **asdf** sub-package contains code that is used to serialize ``astropy``
types so that they can be represented and stored using the Advanced Scientific
Data Format (ASDF).

If both **asdf** and **astropy** are installed, no further configuration is
required in order to process ASDF files that contain **astropy** types. The
**asdf** package has been designed to automatically detect the presence of the
tags defined by **astropy**.

For convenience, users can write `~astropy.table.Table` objects to ASDF files
using the :ref:`table_io`. See :ref:`asdf_io` below.

Documentation on the ASDF Standard can be found `here
<https://asdf-standard.readthedocs.io>`__. Documentation on the ASDF Python
module can be found `here <https://asdf.readthedocs.io>`__. Additional details
for Astropy developers can be found in :ref:`asdf_dev`.

.. note::
   ``astropy.io.misc.asdf`` is being replaced by the **asdf-astropy** package.
   It is recommended that you install this package if you wish to use **ASDF**
   with ``astropy``. The documentation for **asdf-astropy** can be found
   :ref:`asdf-astropy:asdf-astropy`.

Using ASDF With Table I/O
-------------------------

ASDF provides readers and writers for `~astropy.table.Table` using the
:ref:`table_io`. This makes it convenient to read and write ASDF files with
`~astropy.table.Table` data.

Basic Usage
^^^^^^^^^^^

Given a table, it is possible to write it out to an ASDF file::

    from astropy.table import Table

    # Create a simple table
    t = Table(dtype=[('a', 'f4'), ('b', 'i4'), ('c', 'S2')])
    # Write the table to an ASDF file
    t.write('table.asdf')

The I/O registry automatically selects the appropriate writer function to use
based on the ``.asdf`` extension of the output file.

Reading a file generated in this way is also possible using
`~astropy.table.Table.read`::

    t2 = Table.read('table.asdf')

The I/O registry automatically selects the appropriate reader function based on
the extension of the input file.

In the case of both reading and writing, if the file extension is not ``.asdf``
it is possible to explicitly specify the reader/writer function to be used::

    t3 = Table.read('table.zxcv', format='asdf')

Advanced Usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The fundamental ASDF data structure is the tree, which is a nested
combination of basic data structures (see `this
<https://asdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/asdf/features.html#data-model>`_
for a more detailed description). At the top level, the tree is a `dict`.

The consequence of this is that a `~astropy.table.Table` object (or any object,
for that matter) can be stored at any arbitrary location within an ASDF tree.
The basic writer use case described above stores the given
`~astropy.table.Table` at the top of the tree using a default key. The basic
reader case assumes that a `~astropy.table.Table` is stored in the same place.

However, it may sometimes be useful for users to specify a different top-level
key to be used for storage and retrieval of a `~astropy.table.Table` from an
ASDF file. For this reason, the ASDF I/O interface provides ``data_key`` as an
optional keyword when writing and reading::

    from astropy.table import Table

    t = Table(dtype=[('a', 'f4'), ('b', 'i4'), ('c', 'S2')])
    # Write the table to an ASDF file using a non-default key
    t.write('foo.asdf', data_key='foo')

A `~astropy.table.Table` stored using a custom data key can be retrieved by
passing the same argument to `~astropy.table.Table.read`::

    foo = Table.read('foo.asdf', data_key='foo')

The ``data_key`` option only applies to `~astropy.table.Table` objects that are
stored at the top of the ASDF tree. For full generality, users may pass a
callback when writing or reading ASDF files to define precisely where the
`~astropy.table.Table` object should be placed in the tree. The option for the
write case is ``make_tree``. The function callback should accept exactly one
argument, which is the `~astropy.table.Table` object, and should return a
`dict` representing the tree to be stored::

    def make_custom_tree(table):
        # Return a nested tree where the table is stored at the second level
        return dict(foo=dict(bar=table))

    t = Table(dtype=[('a', 'f4'), ('b', 'i4'), ('c', 'S2')])
    # Write the table to an ASDF file using a non-default key
    t.write('foobar.asdf', make_tree=make_custom_tree)

Similarly, when reading an ASDF file, the user can pass a custom callback to
locate the table within the ASDF tree. The option in this case is
``find_table``. The callback should accept exactly one argument, which is an
`dict` representing the ASDF tree, and it should return a
`~astropy.table.Table` object::

    def find_table(tree):
        # This returns the Table that was stored by the example above
        return tree['foo']['bar']

    foo = Table.read('foobar.asdf', find_table=find_table)

.. _asdf_dev:

Details
-------

The **asdf** sub-package defines classes, referred to as **tags**, that
implement the logic for serialization and deserialization of ``astropy`` types.
Users should never need to refer to tag implementations directly. Their
presence should be entirely transparent when processing ASDF files.

ASDF makes use of abstract data type definitions called **schemas**. The tag
classes provided here are specific implementations of particular schemas. Some
of the tags in ``astropy`` (e.g., those related to transforms) implement schemas
that are defined by the ASDF Standard. In other cases, both the tags and
schemas are defined within ``astropy`` (e.g., those related to many of the
coordinate frames). Documentation of the individual schemas defined by
``astropy`` can be found below in the :ref:`asdf_schemas` section.

Not all ``astropy`` types are currently serializable by ASDF. Attempting to
write unsupported types to an ASDF file will lead to a ``RepresenterError``. In
order to support new types, new tags and schemas must be created. See `Writing
ASDF Extensions <https://asdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/asdf/extending/legacy.html>`_
for additional details, as well as the following example.

Example: Adding a New Object to the Astropy ASDF Extension
----------------------------------------------------------

In this example, we will show how to implement serialization for a new
`~astropy.modeling.Model` object, but the basic principles apply to
serialization of other ``astropy`` objects. As mentioned, adding a new object
to the ``astropy``  ASDF extension requires both a tag and a schema.

All schemas for transforms are currently defined within the ASDF standard.
Any new serializable transforms must have a corresponding new
schema here. Let's consider a new model called ``MyModel``, a new model in
``astropy.modeling.functional_models`` that has two parameters ``amplitude``
and ``x_0``. We would like to strictly require both of these parameters be set.
We would also like to specify that these parameters can either be numeric type,
or ``astropy.units.quantity`` type. A schema describing this
model would look like::

    %YAML 1.1
    ---
    $schema: "http://stsci.edu/schemas/yaml-schema/draft-01"
    id: "http://stsci.edu/schemas/asdf/transform/mymodel-1.0.0"
    tag: "tag:stsci.edu:asdf/transform/mymodel-1.0.0"
    title: >
      Example new model.

    description: >
      Example new model, which describes the distribution of ABC.

    allOf:
      - $ref: "transform-1.2.0"
      - type: object
        properties:
          amplitude:
            anyOf:
              - $ref: "../unit/quantity-1.1.0"
              - type: number
            description: Amplitude of distribution.
          x_0:
            anyOf:
              - $ref: "../unit/quantity-1.1.0"
              - type: number
            description: X center position.

        required: ['amplitude', 'x_0]
    ...

All new transform schemas reference the base transform schema of the latest
type. This schema describes the other model attributes that are common to all
or many models, so that individual schemas only handle the parameters specific
to that model. Additionally, this schema references the latest version
of the ``quantity`` schema, so that models can retain information about units
and quantities. References allow previously defined objects to be used inside
new custom types.

The next component is the tag class. This class must have a ``to_tree`` method
in which the required attributes of the object in question are obtained, and a
``from_tree`` method which reconstructs the object based on the parameters
written to the ASDF file. ``astropy`` Models inherit from the
``TransformType`` base class tag, which takes care of attributes (e.g ``name``,
``bounding_box``, ``n_inputs``) that are common to all or many Model classes to
limit redundancy in individual tags. Each individual model tag then only has
to obtain and set model-specific parameters::

    from .basic import TransformType
    from . import _parameter_to_value

    class MyModelType(TransformType):
    name = 'transform/mymodel'
    version = '1.0.0'
    types = ['astropy.modeling.functional_models.MyModel']

    @classmethod
    def from_tree_transform(cls, node, ctx):
        return functional_models.MyModel(amplitude=node['amplitude'],
                                         x_0=node['x_0'])

    @classmethod
    def to_tree_transform(cls, model, ctx):
        node = {'amplitude': _parameter_to_value(amplitude),
                'x_0': _parameter_to_value(x_0)}
        return node

This tag class contains all the machinery to deconstruct objects to and
reconstruct them from ASDF files. The tag class - by convention named by the
object name appended with 'Type' - references the schema and version, and the
object in ``astropy.modeling.functional_models``. The basic model parameters
are handled in the ``to_tree_transform`` and ``from_tree_transform`` of the
base ``TransformType`` class, while model-specific parameters are handled here
in ``MyModelType``. Since this model can take units and quantities with input
parameters, the imported ``_parameter_to_value`` allows this to flexibly work
with both basic numeric values as well as quantities.
