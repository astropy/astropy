FITS File handling (`astropy.io.fits`)
**************************************

Introduction
============

The :mod:`astropy.io.fits` package provides access to FITS files. FITS
(Flexible Image Transport System) is a portable file standard widely used in
the astronomy community to store images and tables.

.. _tutorial:

Getting Started
===============

This section provides a quick introduction of using :mod:`astropy.io.fits`. The
goal is to demonstrate the package's basic features without getting into too
much detail. If you are a first time user or have never used Astropy or PyFITS,
this is where you should start.  See also the :ref:`FAQ <io-fits-faq>` for
answers to common questions/issues.

.. note::

    If you want to read or write a single table in FITS format then the
    simplest method is often via the high-level :ref:`table_io`.  In particular
    see the :ref:`Unified I/O FITS <table_io_fits>` section.

Reading and Updating Existing FITS Files
----------------------------------------

Opening a FITS file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the `astropy.io.fits` package is loaded using the standard convention\
[#f1]_, we can open an existing FITS file::

    >>> from astropy.io import fits
    >>> hdulist = fits.open('input.fits')

The :func:`open` function has several optional arguments which will be
discussed in a later chapter. The default mode, as in the above example, is
"readonly".  The open function returns an object called an :class:`HDUList`
which is a `list`-like collection of HDU objects. An HDU (Header Data Unit) is
the highest level component of the FITS file structure, consisting of a header
and (typically) a data array or table.

After the above open call, ``hdulist[0]`` is the primary HDU, ``hdulist[1]`` is
the first extension HDU, etc (if there are any extensions), and so on.  It
should be noted that Astropy is using zero-based indexing when referring to
HDUs and header cards, though the FITS standard (which was designed with
FORTRAN in mind) uses one-based indexing.

The :class:`HDUList` has a useful method :meth:`HDUList.info`, which
summarizes the content of the opened FITS file:

    >>> hdulist.info()
    Filename: test1.fits
    No. Name  Type       Cards Dimensions Format
    0 PRIMARY PrimaryHDU   220 ()         int16
    1 SCI     ImageHDU      61 (800, 800) float32
    2 SCI     ImageHDU      61 (800, 800) float32
    3 SCI     ImageHDU      61 (800, 800) float32
    4 SCI     ImageHDU      61 (800, 800) float32

After you are done with the opened file, close it with the
:meth:`HDUList.close` method:

    >>> hdulist.close()

The headers will still be accessible after the HDUList is closed. The data may
or may not be accessible depending on whether the data are touched and if they
are memory-mapped, see later chapters for detail.

.. _fits-large-files:

Working with large files
""""""""""""""""""""""""

The :func:`open` function supports a ``memmap=True`` argument that allows the
array data of each HDU to be accessed with mmap, rather than being read into
memory all at once.  This is particularly useful for working with very large
arrays that cannot fit entirely into physical memory.

This has minimal impact on smaller files as well, though some operations, such
as reading the array data sequentially, may incur some additional overhead.  On
32-bit systems arrays larger than 2-3 GB cannot be mmap'd (which is fine,
because by that point you're likely to run out of physical memory anyways), but
64-bit systems are much less limited in this respect.

.. warning::
	When opening a file with ``memmap=True``, because of how mmap works this means that 
	when the HDU data is accessed (i.e. ``hdul[0].data``) another handle to the FITS file
	is opened by mmap. This means that even after calling ``hdul.close()`` the mmap still
	holds an open handle to the data so that it can still be accessed by unwary programs
	that were built with the assumption that the .data attribute has all the data in-memory.

	In order to force the mmap to close either wait for the containing ``HDUList`` object to go 
	out of scope, or manually call ``del hdul[0].data`` (this works so long as there are no other
	references held to the data array).

Unsigned integers
"""""""""""""""""

Due to the FITS format's FORTRAN origins, FITS does not natively support
unsigned integer data in images or tables.  However, there is a common
convention to store unsigned integers as signed integers, along with a
*shift* instruction (a ``BZERO`` keyword with value ``2 ** (BITPIX - 1)``) to
shift up all signed integers to unsigned inters.  For example, when writing
the value ``0`` as an unsigned 32-bit integer, it is stored in the FITS
file as ``-32768``, along with the header keyword ``BZERO = 32768``.

Astropy recognizes and applies this convention by default, so that all data
that looks like it should be interpreted as unsigned integers is automatically
converted (this applies to both images and tables).  In Astropy versions prior
to v1.1.0 this was *not* applied automatically, and it is necessary to pass the
argument ``uint=True`` to :func:`open`.  In v1.1.0 or later this is the
default.

Even with ``uint=False``, the ``BZERO`` shift is still applied, but the
returned array is of "float64" type.  To disable scaling/shifting entirely, use
``do_not_scale_image_data=True`` (see :ref:`fits-scaled-data-faq` in the FAQ
for more details).

Working with compressed files
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The :func:`open` function will seamlessly open FITS files that have been
compressed with gzip, bzip2 or pkzip. Note that in this context we're talking
about a fits file that has been compressed with one of these utilities - e.g. a 
.fits.gz file. Files that use compressed HDUs within the FITS file are discussed
in :ref:`Compressed Image Data <astropy-io-fits-compressedImageData>`.

There are some limitations with working with compressed files. For example with Zip 
files that contain multiple compressed files, only the first file will be accessible.
Also bzip does not support the append or update access modes.

When writing a file (e.g. with the :func:`writeto` function), compression will be
determined based on the filename extension given, or the compression used in a 
pre-existing file that is being written to.

Working with FITS Headers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As mentioned earlier, each element of an :class:`HDUList` is an HDU object with
``.header`` and ``.data`` attributes, which can be used to access the header
and data portions of the HDU.

For those unfamiliar with FITS headers, they consist of a list of 80 byte
"cards", where a card contains a keyword, a value, and a comment.  The keyword
and comment must both be strings, whereas the value can be a string or an
integer, floating point number, complex number, or `True`/`False`.  Keywords
are usually unique within a header, except in a few special cases.

The header attribute is a Header instance, another Astropy object. To get the
value associated with a header keyword, simply do (a la Python dicts)::

    >>> hdulist[0].header['targname']
    'NGC121'

to get the value of the keyword targname, which is a string 'NGC121'.

Although keyword names are always in upper case inside the FITS file,
specifying a keyword name with Astropy is case-insensitive, for the user's
convenience. If the specified keyword name does not exist, it will raise a
`~.exceptions.KeyError` exception.

We can also get the keyword value by indexing (a la Python lists)::

    >>> hdulist[0].header[27]
    96

This example returns the 28th (like Python lists, it is 0-indexed) keyword's
value--an integer--96.

Similarly, it is easy to update a keyword's value in Astropy, either through
keyword name or index::

    >>> prihdr = hdulist[0].header
    >>> prihdr['targname'] = 'NGC121-a'
    >>> prihdr[27] = 99

Please note however that almost all application code should update header
values via their keyword name and not via their positional index.  This is
because most FITS keywords may appear at any position in the header.

It is also possible to update both the value and comment associated with a
keyword by assigning them as a tuple::

    >>> prihdr = hdulist[0].header
    >>> prihdr['targname'] = ('NGC121-a', 'the observation target')
    >>> prihdr['targname']
    'NGC121-a'
    >>> prihdr.comments['targname']
    'the observation target'

Like a dict, one may also use the above syntax to add a new keyword/value pair
(and optionally a comment as well).  In this case the new card is appended to
the end of the header (unless it's a commentary keyword such as COMMENT or
HISTORY, in which case it is appended after the last card with that keyword).

Another way to either update an existing card or append a new one is to use the
:meth:`Header.set` method::

    >>> prihdr.set('observer', 'Edwin Hubble')

Comment or history records are added like normal cards, though in their case a
new card is always created, rather than updating an existing HISTORY or COMMENT
card::

    >>> prihdr['history'] = 'I updated this file 2/26/09'
    >>> prihdr['comment'] = 'Edwin Hubble really knew his stuff'
    >>> prihdr['comment'] = 'I like using HST observations'
    >>> prihdr['history']
    I updated this file 2/26/09
    >>> prihdr['comment']
    Edwin Hubble really knew his stuff
    I like using HST observations

Note: Be careful not to confuse COMMENT cards with the comment value for normal
cards.

To update existing COMMENT or HISTORY cards, reference them by index::

    >>> prihdr['history'][0] = 'I updated this file on 2/27/09'
    >>> prihdr['history']
    I updated this file on 2/27/09
    >>> prihdr['comment'][1] = 'I like using JWST observations'
    >>> prihdr['comment']
    Edwin Hubble really knew his stuff
    I like using JWST observations


To see the entire header as it appears in the FITS file (with the END card and
padding stripped), simply enter the header object by itself, or
``print(repr(header))``::

    >>> header
    SIMPLE  =                    T / file does conform to FITS standard
    BITPIX  =                   16 / number of bits per data pixel
    NAXIS   =                    0 / number of data axes
    all cards are shown...
    >>> print(repr(header))
    ... identical ...

Entering simply ``print(header)`` will also work, but may not be very legible
on most displays, as this displays the header as it is written in the FITS file
itself, which means there are no linebreaks between cards.  This is a common
source of confusion for new users.

It's also possible to view a slice of the header::

   >>> header[:2]
   SIMPLE  =                    T / file does conform to FITS standard
   BITPIX  =                   16 / number of bits per data pixel

Only the first two cards are shown above.

To get a list of all keywords, use the :meth:`Header.keys` method just as you
would with a dict::

    >>> prihdr.keys()
    ['SIMPLE', 'BITPIX', 'NAXIS', ...]


Working with Image Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If an HDU's data is an image, the data attribute of the HDU object will return
a numpy `~numpy.ndarray` object. Refer to the numpy documentation for details
on manipulating these numerical arrays.

::

    >>> scidata = hdulist[1].data

Here, scidata points to the data object in the second HDU (the first HDU,
``hdulist[0]``, being the primary HDU) which corresponds to the 'SCI'
extension. Alternatively, you can access the extension by its extension name
(specified in the EXTNAME keyword)::

    >>> scidata = hdulist['SCI'].data

If there is more than one extension with the same EXTNAME, the EXTVER value
needs to be specified along with the EXTNAME as a tuple; e.g.::

    >>> scidata = hdulist['sci',2].data

Note that the EXTNAME is also case-insensitive.

The returned numpy object has many attributes and methods for a user to get
information about the array, e.g.

::

    >>> scidata.shape
    (800, 800)
    >>> scidata.dtype.name
    'float32'

Since image data is a numpy object, we can slice it, view it, and perform
mathematical operations on it. To see the pixel value at x=5, y=2::

    >>> print(scidata[1, 4])

Note that, like C (and unlike FORTRAN), Python is 0-indexed and the indices
have the slowest axis first and fastest changing axis last; i.e. for a 2-D
image, the fast axis (X-axis) which corresponds to the FITS NAXIS1 keyword, is
the second index. Similarly, the 1-indexed sub-section of x=11 to 20
(inclusive) and y=31 to 40 (inclusive) would be given in Python as::

    >>> scidata[30:40, 10:20]

To update the value of a pixel or a sub-section::

    >>> scidata[30:40, 10:20] = scidata[1, 4] = 999

This example changes the values of both the pixel \[1, 4] and the sub-section
\[30:40, 10:20] to the new value of 999.  See the `Numpy documentation`_ for
more details on Python-style array indexing and slicing.

The next example of array manipulation is to convert the image data from counts
to flux::

    >>> photflam = hdulist[1].header['photflam']
    >>> exptime = prihdr['exptime']
    >>> scidata *= photflam / exptime

Note that performing an operation like this on an entire image requires holding
the entire image in memory.  This example performs the multiplication in-place
so that no copies are made, but the original image must first be able to fit in
main memory.  For most observations this should not be an issue on modern
personal computers.

If at this point you want to preserve all the changes you made and write it to
a new file, you can use the :meth:`HDUList.writeto` method (see below).

.. _Numpy documentation: http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/arrays.indexing.html


Working With Table Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section describes reading and writing table data in the FITS format using
the `~astropy.io.fits` package directly.  For simple cases, however, the
high-level :ref:`table_io` will often suffice and is somewhat easier to use.
See the :ref:`Unified I/O FITS <table_io_fits>` section for details.

Like images, the data portion of a FITS table extension is in the ``.data``
attribute::

    >>> hdulist = fits.open('table.fits')
    >>> tbdata = hdulist[1].data # assuming the first extension is a table

If you are familiar with numpy `~numpy.recarray` (record array) objects, you
will find the table data is basically a record array with some extra
properties. But familiarity with record arrays is not a prerequisite for this
guide.

To see the first row of the table::

    >>> print(tbdata[0])
    (1, 'abc', 3.7000002861022949, 0)

Each row in the table is a :class:`FITS_record` object which looks like a
(Python) tuple containing elements of heterogeneous data types. In this
example: an integer, a string, a floating point number, and a Boolean value. So
the table data are just an array of such records. More commonly, a user is
likely to access the data in a column-wise way. This is accomplished by using
the :meth:`~FITS_rec.field` method. To get the first column (or "field" in
Numpy parlance--it is used here interchangeably with "column") of the table,
use::

    >>> tbdata.field(0)
    array([1, 2])

A numpy object with the data type of the specified field is returned.

Like header keywords, a column can be referred either by index, as above, or by
name::

    >>> tbdata.field('id')
    array([1, 2])

When accessing a column by name, dict-like access is also possible (and even
preferable)::

    >>> tbdata['id']
    array([1, 2])

In most cases it is preferable to access columns by their name, as the column
name is entirely independent of its physical order in the table.  As with
header keywords, column names are case-insensitive.

But how do we know what columns we have in a table? First, let's introduce
another attribute of the table HDU: the :attr:`~BinTableHDU.columns`
attribute::

    >>> cols = hdulist[1].columns

This attribute is a :class:`ColDefs` (column definitions) object. If we use the
:meth:`ColDefs.info` method from the interactive prompt::

    >>> cols.info()
     name:
          ['c1', 'c2', 'c3', 'c4']
     format:
          ['1J', '3A', '1E', '1L']
     unit:
          ['', '', '', '']
     null:
          [-2147483647, '', '', '']
     bscale:
          ['', '', 3, '']
     bzero:
          ['', '', 0.40000000000000002, '']
     disp:
          ['I11', 'A3', 'G15.7', 'L6']
     start:
          ['', '', '', '']
     dim:
          ['', '', '', '']

it will show the attributes of all columns in the table, such as their names,
formats, bscales, bzeros, etc. A similar output that will display the column
names and their formats can be printed from within a script with::

    print hdulist[1].columns

We can also get these properties individually;
e.g.

::

    >>> cols.names
    ['ID', 'name', 'mag', 'flag']

returns a (Python) list of field names.

Since each field is a Numpy object, we'll have the entire arsenal of Numpy
tools to use. We can reassign (update) the values::

    >>> tbdata['flag'][:] = 0

take the mean of a column::

    >>> tbdata['mag'].mean()
    >>> 84.4

and so on.


Save File Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As mentioned earlier, after a user opened a file, made a few changes to either
header or data, the user can use :meth:`HDUList.writeto` to save the changes.
This takes the version of headers and data in memory and writes them to a new
FITS file on disk. Subsequent operations can be performed to the data in memory
and written out to yet another different file, all without recopying the
original data to (more) memory.

::

    >>> hdulist.writeto('newimage.fits')

will write the current content of ``hdulist`` to a new disk file newfile.fits.
If a file was opened with the update mode, the :meth:`HDUList.flush` method can
also be used to write all the changes made since :func:`open`, back to the
original file. The :meth:`~HDUList.close` method will do the same for a FITS
file opened with update mode::

    >>> f = fits.open('original.fits', mode='update')
    ... # making changes in data and/or header
    >>> f.flush()  # changes are written back to original.fits
    >>> f.close()  # closing the file will also flush any changes and prevent
    ...            # further writing


Creating a New FITS File
------------------------

Creating a New Image File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

So far we have demonstrated how to read and update an existing FITS file. But
how about creating a new FITS file from scratch? Such tasks are very easy in
Astropy for an image HDU. We'll first demonstrate how to create a FITS file
consisting only the primary HDU with image data.

First, we create a numpy object for the data part::

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> n = np.arange(100.0) # a simple sequence of floats from 0.0 to 99.9

Next, we create a :class:`PrimaryHDU` object to encapsulate the data::

    >>> hdu = fits.PrimaryHDU(n)

We then create a HDUList to contain the newly created primary HDU, and write to
a new file::

    >>> hdulist = fits.HDUList([hdu])
    >>> hdulist.writeto('new.fits')

That's it! In fact, Astropy even provides a shortcut for the last two lines to
accomplish the same behavior::

    >>> hdu.writeto('new.fits')

This will write a single HDU to a FITS file without having to manually
encapsulate it in an :class:`HDUList` object first.


Creating a New Table File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create a table HDU is a little more involved than image HDU, because a
table's structure needs more information. First of all, tables can only be an
extension HDU, not a primary. There are two kinds of FITS table extensions:
ASCII and binary. We'll use binary table examples here.

To create a table from scratch, we need to define columns first, by
constructing the :class:`Column` objects and their data. Suppose we have two
columns, the first containing strings, and the second containing floating point
numbers::

    >>> from astropy.io import fits
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> a1 = np.array(['NGC1001', 'NGC1002', 'NGC1003'])
    >>> a2 = np.array([11.1, 12.3, 15.2])
    >>> col1 = fits.Column(name='target', format='20A', array=a1)
    >>> col2 = fits.Column(name='V_mag', format='E', array=a2)

Next, create a :class:`ColDefs` (column-definitions) object for all columns::

    >>> cols = fits.ColDefs([col1, col2])

Now, create a new binary table HDU object by using the
:func:`BinTableHDU.from_columns` function::

    >>> tbhdu = fits.BinTableHDU.from_columns(cols)

This function returns (in this case) a :class:`BinTableHDU`.

Of course, you can do this more concisely without creating intermediate
variables for the individual columns and without manually creating a
:class:`ColDefs` object::


    >>> from astropy.io import fits
    >>> tbhdu = fits.BinTableHDU.from_columns(
    ...     [fits.Column(name='target', format='20A', array=a1),
    ...      fits.Column(name='V_mag', format='E', array=a2)])

Now you may write this new table HDU directly to a FITS file like so::

    >>> tbhdu.writeto('table.fits')

This shortcut will automatically create a minimal primary HDU with no data and
prepend it to the table HDU to create a valid FITS file.  If you require
additional data or header keywords in the primary HDU you may still create a
:class:`PrimaryHDU` object and build up the FITS file manually using an
:class:`HDUList`.

For example, first create a new :class:`Header` object to encapsulate any
keywords you want to include in the primary HDU, then as before create a
:class:`PrimaryHDU`::

    >>> prihdr = fits.Header()
    >>> prihdr['OBSERVER'] = 'Edwin Hubble'
    >>> prihdr['COMMENT'] = "Here's some commentary about this FITS file."
    >>> prihdu = fits.PrimaryHDU(header=prihdr)

When we create a new primary HDU with a custom header as in the above example,
this will automatically include any additional header keywords that are
*required* by the FITS format (keywords such as ``SIMPLE`` and ``NAXIS`` for
example).  In general, users should not have to manually manage such keywords,
and should only create and modify observation-specific informational keywords.

We then create a HDUList containing both the primary HDU and the newly created
table extension, and write to a new file::

    >>> thdulist = fits.HDUList([prihdu, tbhdu])
    >>> thdulist.writeto('table.fits')

Alternatively, we can append the table to the HDU list we already created in
the image file section::

    >>> hdulist.append(tbhdu)
    >>> hdulist.writeto('image_and_table.fits')

The data structure used to represent FITS tables is called a :class:`FITS_rec`
and is derived from the :class:`numpy.recarray` interface.  When creating
a new table HDU the individual column arrays will be assembled into a single
:class:`FITS_rec` array.

So far, we have covered the most basic features of `astropy.io.fits`. In the
following chapters we'll show more advanced examples and explain options in
each class and method.


Convenience Functions
---------------------

`astropy.io.fits` also provides several high level ("convenience") functions.
Such a convenience function is a "canned" operation to achieve one simple task.
By using these "convenience" functions, a user does not have to worry about
opening or closing a file, all the housekeeping is done implicitly.

.. warning::

    These functions are useful for interactive Python sessions and simple
    analysis scripts, but should not be used for application code, as they
    are highly inefficient.  For example, each call to :func:`getval`
    requires re-parsing the entire FITS file.  Code that makes repeated use
    of these functions should instead open the file with :func:`open`
    and access the data structures directly.

The first of these functions is :func:`getheader`, to get the header of an HDU.
Here are several examples of getting the header. Only the file name is required
for this function. The rest of the arguments are optional and flexible to
specify which HDU the user wants to access::

    >>> from astropy.io.fits import getheader
    >>> getheader('in.fits')  # get default HDU (=0), i.e. primary HDU's header
    >>> getheader('in.fits', 0)  # get primary HDU's header
    >>> getheader('in.fits', 2)  # the second extension
    >>> getheader('in.fits', 'sci')  # the first HDU with EXTNAME='SCI'
    >>> getheader('in.fits', 'sci', 2)  # HDU with EXTNAME='SCI' and EXTVER=2
    >>> getheader('in.fits', ('sci', 2))  # use a tuple to do the same
    >>> getheader('in.fits', ext=2)  # the second extension
    >>> getheader('in.fits', extname='sci')  # first HDU with EXTNAME='SCI'
    >>> getheader('in.fits', extname='sci', extver=2)

Ambiguous specifications will raise an exception::

    >>> getheader('in.fits', ext=('sci', 1), extname='err', extver=2)
    ...
    TypeError: Redundant/conflicting extension arguments(s): {'ext': ('sci',
    1), 'args': (), 'extver': 2, 'extname': 'err'}

After you get the header, you can access the information in it, such as getting
and modifying a keyword value::

    >>> from astropy.io.fits import getheader
    >>> hdr = getheader('in.fits', 1)  # get first extension's header
    >>> filter = hdr['filter']         # get the value of the keyword "filter'
    >>> val = hdr[10]                  # get the 11th keyword's value
    >>> hdr['filter'] = 'FW555'        # change the keyword value

For the header keywords, the header is like a dictionary, as well as a list.
The user can access the keywords either by name or by numeric index, as
explained earlier in this chapter.

If a user only needs to read one keyword, the  :func:`getval` function can
further simplify to just one call, instead of two as shown in the above
examples::

    >>> from astropy.io.fits import getval
    >>> flt = getval('in.fits', 'filter', 1)  # get 1st extension's keyword
                                              # FILTER's value
    >>> val = getval('in.fits', 10, 'sci', 2)  # get the 2nd sci extension's
                                               # 11th keyword's value

The function :func:`getdata` gets the data of an HDU. Similar to
:func:`getheader`, it only requires the input FITS file name while the
extension is specified through the optional arguments. It does have one extra
optional argument header. If header is set to True, this function will return
both data and header, otherwise only data is returned::

    >>> from astropy.io.fits import getdata
    >>> dat = getdata('in.fits', 'sci', 3)  # get 3rd sci extension's data
    ... # get 1st extension's data and header
    >>> data, hdr = getdata('in.fits', 1, header=True)

The functions introduced above are for reading. The next few functions
demonstrate convenience functions for writing::

    >>> fits.writeto('out.fits', data, header)

The :func:`writeto` function uses the provided data and an optional header to
write to an output FITS file.

::

    >>> fits.append('out.fits', data, header)

The :func:`append` function will use the provided data and the optional header
to append to an existing FITS file. If the specified output file does not
exist, it will create one.

::

    >>> from astropy.io.fits import update
    >>> update(file, dat, hdr, 'sci')  # update the 'sci' extension
    >>> update(file, dat, 3)           # update the 3rd extension
    >>> update(file, dat, hdr, 3)      # update the 3rd extension
    >>> update(file, dat, 'sci', 2)    # update the 2nd SCI extension
    >>> update(file, dat, 3, header=hdr)      # update the 3rd extension
    >>> update(file, dat, header=hdr, ext=5)  # update the 5th extension

The :func:`update` function will update the specified extension with the input
data/header. The 3rd argument can be the header associated with the data. If
the 3rd argument is not a header, it (and other positional arguments) are
assumed to be the extension specification(s). Header and extension specs can
also be keyword arguments.

Finally, the :func:`info` function will print out information of the specified
FITS file::

    >>> fits.info('test0.fits')
    Filename: test0.fits
    No. Name    Type       Cards Dimensions Format
    0   PRIMARY PrimaryHDU   138 ()         Int16
    1   SCI     ImageHDU      61 (400, 400) Int16
    2   SCI     ImageHDU      61 (400, 400) Int16
    3   SCI     ImageHDU      61 (400, 400) Int16
    4   SCI     ImageHDU      61 (400, 400) Int16

This is one of the most useful convenience functions for getting an overview of
what a given file contains without looking at any of the details.
