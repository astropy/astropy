Using ``astropy.vo.validator``
==============================

VO services validator is used by STScI to support :ref:`vo-sec-client-scs`.
Currently, only Cone Search services are supported.
A typical user should not need the validator. However, this could be used by
VO service providers to validate their services. Currently, any service
to be validated has to be registered in STScI VAO Registry.


.. _vo-sec-validator-validate:

Validation for Simple Cone Search
---------------------------------

`astropy.vo.validator.validate` validates VO services.
Currently, only Cone Search validation is done using
:func:`~astropy.vo.validator.validate.check_conesearch_sites`,
which utilizes underlying `astropy.io.votable.validator` library.

A master list of all available Cone Search services is
obtained from ``astropy.vo.validator.validate.CS_MSTR_LIST``, which
is a URL query to STScI VAO Registry by default.
However, by default, only the ones in ``astropy.vo.validator.validate.CS_URLS``
are validated (also see :ref:`vo-sec-default-scs-services`),
while the rest are skipped. There are also options to validate
a user-defined list of services or all of them.

All Cone Search queries are done using RA, DEC, and SR given by
``<testQuery>`` XML tag in the registry, and maximum verbosity.
In an uncommon case where ``<testQuery>`` is not defined for a service,
it uses a default search for ``RA=0&DEC=0&SR=1``.

The results are separated into 4 groups below. Each group
is stored as a JSON database:

    #. *conesearch_good.json*
           Passed validation without critical warnings and
           exceptions. This database residing in
           ``astropy.vo.client.vos_catalog.BASEURL`` is the one used
           by :ref:`vo-sec-client-scs` by default.
    #. *conesearch_warn.json*
           Has critical warnings but no exceptions. Users
           can manually set
           ``astropy.vo.client.conesearch.CONESEARCH_DBNAME``
           to use this at their own risk.
    #. *conesearch_exception.json*
           Has some exceptions. *Never* use this.
           For informational purpose only.
    #. *conesearch_error.json*
           Has network connection error. *Never* use this.
           For informational purpose only.

HTML pages summarizing the validation results are stored in
'results' sub-directory, which also contains downloaded XML
files from individual Cone Search queries.

Warnings and Exceptions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A subset of `astropy.io.votable.exceptions` that is considered
non-critical is defined by ``astropy.vo.validator.validate.NONCRIT_WARNINGS``,
which will not be flagged as bad by the validator. However,
this does not change the behavior of ``astropy.io.votable.table.PEDANTIC``,
which still needs to be set to `False` for them not to be thrown out
by :func:`~astropy.vo.client.conesearch.conesearch`.
Despite being listed as non-critical, user is responsible
to check whether the results are reliable; They should not be
used blindly.

Some
`units recognized by VizieR <http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/vizier/Units.htx>`_
are considered invalid by Cone Search standards. As a result,
they will give the warning 'W50', which is non-critical by default.

User can also modify ``astropy.vo.validator.validate.NONCRIT_WARNINGS`` to
include or exclude any warnings or exceptions, as desired.
However, this should be done with caution. Adding exceptions
to non-critical list is not recommended.

Building the Database
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each Cone Search service is a catalog in the JSON database,
which is represented by a nested dictionary::

    {
        "__version__": 1,
        "catalogs": {
            "catalog 1": {
                "some key": "some value",
                # ...
            },
            "catalog 2": {
                "some key": "some value",
                # ...
            },
            # ...
        }
    }

In the master registry, there are duplicate catalog titles with
different access URLs, duplicate access URLs with different titles,
duplicate catalogs with slightly different descriptions, etc.

A Cone Search service is really defined by its access URL
regardless of title, description, etc. The validator ensures
each access URL is unique across all the output databases.
However, for user-friendly catalog listing, its title will be
the catalog key, not the access URL.

In the case of two different access URLs sharing the same title,
each URL will have its own database entry, with a sequence number
appended to their titles (e.g., 'Title 1' and 'Title 2'). For
consistency, even if the title does not repeat, it will still be
renamed to 'Title 1'.

In the case of the same access URL appearing multiple times in
the registry, the validator will store the first catalog with
that access URL and throw out the rest. However, it will keep
count of the number of duplicates thrown out in the
'duplicatesIgnored' dictionary key of the catalog kept in the
database.

All the existing catalog tags will be copied over as dictionary
keys, except 'accessURL' that is renamed to 'url' for simplicity.
In addition, new keys named 'validate_xxx' are added; 'xxx' will
be the original attribute names of
`astropy.io.votable.validator.result.Result`.

Configurable Items
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These parameters are set via :ref:`astropy_config`:

    * ``astropy.utils.data.REMOTE_TIMEOUT``
    * ``astropy.vo.validator.validate.CS_MSTR_LIST``
    * ``astropy.vo.validator.validate.CS_URLS``
    * ``astropy.vo.validator.validate.NONCRIT_WARNINGS``
    * Also depends on properties in
      :ref:`Simple Cone Search Configurable Items <vo-sec-scs-config>`

Examples
^^^^^^^^

>>> from astropy.vo.validator import validate

Validate default Cone Search sites with multiprocessing
and write results in the current directory. Reading the
master registry can be slow, so setting timeout to at least
30 seconds is recommended:

>>> from astropy.utils.data import REMOTE_TIMEOUT
>>> with REMOTE_TIMEOUT.set_temp(30):
...     validate.check_conesearch_sites()

Validate only the URLs found above without verbose
outputs (except warnings that are controlled by :py:mod:`warnings`)
or multiprocessing, and write results in
'subset' sub-directory instead of the current directory:

>>> with REMOTE_TIMEOUT.set_temp(30):
...     validate.check_conesearch_sites(
...         destdir='./subset', verbose=False, parallel=False, url_list=urls)
WARNING: W49: ... Empty cell illegal for integer fields...
# ...

Add 'W24' from `astropy.io.votable.exceptions` to the list of
non-critical warnings to be ignored and re-run default validation.
This is *not* recommended unless you know exactly what you are doing:

>>> validate.NONCRIT_WARNINGS.set(validate.NONCRIT_WARNINGS() + ['W24'])
>>> with REMOTE_TIMEOUT.set_temp(30):
...     validate.check_conesearch_sites()

Reset the list of ignored warnings back to default value.
Validate *all* Cone Search services in the master registry
(this will take a while) and write results in 'all' sub-directory:

>>> validate.NONCRIT_WARNINGS.set(validate.NONCRIT_WARNINGS.defaultvalue)
>>> with REMOTE_TIMEOUT.set_temp(30):
...     validate.check_conesearch_sites(destdir='./all', url_list=None)

.. _vo-sec-validator-inspect:

Inspection of Validation Results
--------------------------------

`astropy.vo.validator.inspect` inspects results from
:ref:`vo-sec-validator-validate`. It reads in JSON databases
residing in ``astropy.vo.client.vos_catalog.BASEURL``, which
can be changed to point to a different location.

Configurable Items
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This parameter is set via :ref:`astropy_config`:

    * ``astropy.vo.client.vos_catalog.BASEURL``

Examples
^^^^^^^^

Load Cone Search validation results from
``astropy.vo.client.vos_catalog.BASEURL``
(by default, the one used by :ref:`vo-sec-client-scs`):

>>> from astropy.vo.validator import inspect
>>> r = inspect.ConeSearchResults()

Print tally. In this example, there are 15 Cone Search services that
passed validation with non-critical warnings, 15 with critical warnings,
none with exceptions, and 1 with network error:

>>> r.tally()
good: 15 catalog(s)
warn: 15 catalog(s)
exception: 0 catalog(s)
error: 1 catalog(s)
total: 31 catalog(s)

Print a list of good Cone Search catalogs, each with title, access URL,
warning codes collected, and individual warnings:

List Cone Search catalogs with warnings, excluding warnings that
were ignored in ``astropy.vo.validator.validate.NONCRIT_WARNINGS``,
and writes the output to a file named 'warn_cats.txt' in the current
directory. This is useful to see why the services failed validations:

>>> with open('warn_cats.txt', 'w') as fout:
...     r.list_cats('warn', fout=fout, ignore_noncrit=True)

List the titles of all good Cone Search catalogs:

>>> r.catkeys['good']

Load Cone Search validation results from a local directory named 'subset'.
This is useful if you ran your own :ref:`vo-sec-validator-validate`
and wish to inspect the output databases. This example reads in
