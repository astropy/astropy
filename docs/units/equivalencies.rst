Equivalencies
=============

The unit module has machinery for supporting equivalences between
different units in certain contexts. Namely when equations can
uniquely relate a value in one unit to a different unit. A good
example is the equivalence between wavelength, frequency and energy
for specifying a wavelength of radiation. Normally these units are not
convertable, but when understood as representing light, they are
convertable.  This will describe how to use two of the equivalencies
include in `astropy.units` and then describe how to define new
equivalencies.

Equivalencies are used by passing a list of equivalency pairs to the
`to` or `get_converter` methods.

Built-in equivalencies
----------------------

Spectral Units
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`sp` is a function that returns an equivalency list to handle
conversions between wavelength, frequency and energy.

Length and frequency are not normally convertible, so
`to` raises an exception::

  >>> u.nm.to(u.Hz, [1000, 2000])
  UnitsException: 'nm' and 'Hz' are not convertible

However, when passing the result of `sp` as the third argument to the
`to` method, wavelength, frequency and energy can be converted.

  >>> u.nm.to(u.Hz, [1000, 2000], u.sp())
  array([  2.99792458e+14,   1.49896229e+14])
  >>> u.nm.to(u.eV, [1000, 2000], u.sp())
  array([ 1.23984201,  0.61992101])

These equivalencies even work with non-base units::

  >>> # Inches to calories
  >>> u.inch.to(u.Cal, 1, u.sp())
  1.869180759162485e-27

Spectral Flux Density Units
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is also support for spectral flux density units. Their use is
more complex, since it is necessary to also supply the location in the
spectrum for which the conversions will be done, and the units of
those spectral locations. The function that handles these unit
conversions is `sd`.  This function takes as its arguments the unit
and value for the spectral location.  For example::

  >>> u.Jy.to(u.erg / u.cm**2 / u.s / u.Hz, 1., u.sd(u.AA, 3500))
  1.0000000000000001e-23

  >>> u.Jy.to(u.erg / u.cm**2 / u.s / u.micron, 1., u.sd(u.AA, 3500))
  2.4472853714285712e-08

Writing new equivalencies
-------------------------

An equivalence list is just a list of tuples, where each tuple has 4
elements::

  (from_unit, to_unit, forward, backward)

`from_unit` and `to_unit` are the equivalent units.  `forward` and
`backward` are functions that convert values between those units.

For example, in an old definition of the metric liter, it was defined
as the volume of 1000 grams of water at 4âˆ˜C, a standard pressure and a
bunch of other assumptions.  Volumes and masses are not normally
directly convertible, but if we hold those assumptions as true, we
could build an equivalency for them::

  >>> liters_water = [
         (u.l, u.g, lambda x: 1000.0 * x, lambda x: x / 1000.0)
      ]
  >>> u.l.to(u.kg, 1, liters_water)
  1.0

Note that the equivalency can be used with any other compatible units::

  >>> u.gallon.to(u.pound, 1, liters_water)
  8.345404463333525

And it also works in the other direction::

  >>> u.lb.to(u.pint, 1, liters_water)
  0.9586114172355458

Displaying available equivalencies
----------------------------------

The `find_equivalent_units` function also understands equivalencies.
For example, without passing equivalencies, there are no compatible
units for `Hz` in the standard set::

  >>> u.Hz.find_equivalent_units()
  Primary name | Unit definition | Aliases
  Hz           | 1 / (s)         | Hertz, hertz

However, when passing the spectral equivalency, you can see there are
all kinds of things that `Hz` can be converted to::

  >>> u.Hz.find_equivalent_units(u.sp())
  Primary name | Unit definition       | Aliases
