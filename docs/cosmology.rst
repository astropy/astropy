Cosmological Calculations (`astropy.cosmology`)
***********************************************

Introduction
============

The `astropy.cosmology` subpackage contains classes for representing
cosmologies, and utility functions for calculating commonly used
quantities that depend on a cosmological model. This includes
distances, ages and lookback times corresponding to a measured redshift
or the transverse separation corresponding to a measure angular
separation.

An important concept in `astropy.cosmology` is the "current" cosmology.
This is the specific cosmological model and choice of parameters that are
currently active in `astropy`. Other parts of Astropy that require
knowledge of the background cosmology will use this cosmology in their
calculations to maintain consistency. See `Getting Started`_ for a
description of how to change the current cosmology that is in use.




Getting Started
===============

To do a calculation defined in one of the convenience functions, you can
simply call the function with the relevant redshift::

    >>> from astropy import cosmology
    >>> cosmology.distmod(0.5)
    WARNING: No default cosmology has been specified, using 7-year WMAP. [astropy.cosmology.core]
    42.270203330485998

Note that calling these functions without specifying a cosmology will
cause a warning to appear and the default (WMAP7) will be adopted. You
can get rid of this by specifying a default cosmology or setting the
current cosmology directly. The default current cosmology can be changed
by changing the "default_cosmology" option in the ``[cosmology.core]``
section of the configuration file to your preferred cosmology (see
:ref:`astropy_config`). Alternatively, you can use the
`~astropy.cosmology.core.set_current`. function to specify a cosmology
for use in the current python session.

Most of the other functionality is implemented as either methods or
attributes of the current cosmology object. Use
`~astropy.cosmology.core.get_current` to get this object::

    >>> from astropy.cosmology import get_current
    >>> cosmo = get_current()
    >>> cosmo.h
    0.704
    >>> cosmo.lookback_time(1)
    7.788414051773566
    >>> cosmo.critical_density(0)
    9.3100031320204701e-30
    >>> cosmo.critical_density(0.5)
    1.5324265155305696e-29



Using `cosmology`
=================

Most of the functionality is enabled by the
`~astropy.cosmology.core.FLRWCosmology` object. This represents a
homgeneous and isotropic cosmology (a cosmology characterized by the
Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric after the people who solved
Einstein's field equation for this special case).

While `astropy.cosmology` includes a variety of standard cosmologies
with the parameters already defined (see below), you can create a new
`FLRWCosmology` object with arguments giving the hubble parameter, omega
matter and omega lambda (all at z=0):

  >>> from astropy.cosmology import FLRWCosmology
  >>> cosmo = FLRWCosmology(H0=70, Om=0.3, Ol=0.7)
  >>> cosmo
  FLRWCosmology(H0=70, Om=0.3, Ol=0.7, Ok=0)

The methods of this object calculate commonly used quantities with
your cosmology. For example, the comoving distance in Mpc at redshift
4 is given by:

  >>> cosmo.comoving_distance(4)
  7170.366414463296

The age of the universe at z = 0 in Gyr:

  >>> cosmo.age(0)
  13.46698402784007

See the `FLRWCosmology` object docstring for all the methods and
variables available.  There are several standard cosmologies already
defined:

  >>> from cosmology import WMAP7   # WMAP 7-year cosmology
  >>> WMAP7.critical_density(0)       # critical density at z = 0 in g/cm^3
  9.31000313202047e-30

  >>> from cosmology import WMAP5   # WMAP 5-year
  >>> WMAP5.H(3)                    # Hubble parameter at z = 3 in km/s/Mpc
  301.54148311633674


There are also several convenience functions that calculate quantities
without needing to create a Cosmology object.

  >>> from astropy import cosmology
  >>> cosmology.kpc_proper_per_arcmin(3)
  472.91882815884907
  >>> cosmology.arcsec_per_kpc_proper(3)
  0.12687166682195736

These use the current cosmology, unless overridden by a `cosmo=` keyword
argument. A full list of convenience functions is included below, in the
`Reference/API`_ section.

.. note::
    In general it's better to use an explicit cosmology in actual
    science code, when possible (e.g., ``WMAP7.H(0)`` instead of
    ``cosmology.H(0)``). The motivation for this is that when you go back
    to use the code at a later date, the default cosmology may have
    changed. Use of the convenience functions should generally be
    reserved for interactive work or cases where the flexibility of
    quickly changing between different cosmologies is for some reason
    useful. Alternatively, doing ``cosmology.set_current(WMAP7)`` at the
    top of your code will ensure that these are always consistent.


Using `cosmology` inside Astropy
--------------------------------

If you are writing code for the `astropy` core or an affiliated package,
it is strongly recommended that you use the the current cosmology
through the `~astropy.cosmology.core.get_current` function. It also also
recommended that you provide an override option something like the
following::

    def myfunc(...,cosmo=None):
        from astropy.cosmology import get_current

        if cosmo is None:
            cosmo = get_current()

        ... your code here ...

This ensures that all code consistently uses the current cosmology
unless explicitly overridden.
