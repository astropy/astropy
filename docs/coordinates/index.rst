Astronomical Coordinate Systems (`astropy.coordinates`)
*******************************************************

Introduction
============

The `~astropy.coordinates` package provides classes for representing celestial
coordinates, as well as tools for converting between standard systems in a
uniform way.

.. note::
    The current `~astropy.coordinates` framework only accepts scalar
    coordinates, i.e. one coordinate per object.  In the next release it will
    be expanded to accept arrays of coordinates.

.. warning::
    `~astropy.coordinates` is currently a work-in-progress, and thus it is
    possible there will be significant API changes in later versions of
    Astropy.


Getting Started
===============

Coordinate objects are instantiated with a flexible and natural approach that
supports both numeric angle values and (limited) string parsing::

    >>> from astropy import coordinates as coord
    >>> from astropy import units as u
    >>> coord.ICRSCoordinates(ra=10.68458, dec=41.26917, unit=(u.degree, u.degree))
    <ICRSCoordinates RA=10.68458 deg, Dec=41.26917 deg>
    >>> coord.ICRSCoordinates('00h42m44.3s +41d16m9s')
    <ICRSCoordinates RA=10.68458 deg, Dec=41.26917 deg>

The individual components of a coordinate are `~astropy.coordinates.angles.Angle`
objects, and their values are accessed using special attributes::

    >>> c = coord.ICRSCoordinates(ra=10.68458, dec=41.26917, unit=(u.degree, u.degree))
    >>> c.ra
    <RA 10.68458 deg>
    >>> c.ra.hours
    0.7123053333333333
    >>> c.ra.hms
    (0.0, 42, 44.2992000000001)
    >>> c.dec
    <Dec 41.26917 deg>
    >>> c.dec.radians
    0.7202828960652683

To convert to some other coordinate system, the easiest method is to use
attribute-style access with short names for the built-in systems, but explicit
transformations via the `transform_to` method are also available::

    >>> c.galactic
    <GalacticCoordinates l=121.17422 deg, b=-21.57283 deg>
    >>> c.transform_to(coord.GalacticCoordinates)
    <GalacticCoordinates l=121.17422 deg, b=-21.57283 deg>

Distances from the origin (which is system-dependent, but often the Earth
center) can also be assigned to a coordinate. This specifies a unique point
in 3D space, which also allows conversion to cartesian coordinates::

    >>> c = coord.ICRSCoordinates(ra=10.68458, dec=41.26917, unit=(u.degree, u.degree), distance=coord.Distance(770, u.kpc))
    >>> c.x
    568.7128654235232
    >>> c.y
    107.3008974042025
    >>> c.z
    507.88994291875713

The `Coordinates` subpackage also provides a quick way to get coordinates
for named objects (with an internet connection). All subclasses of 
`~astropy.coordinates.coordsystems.SphericalCoordinatesBase` have a special
class method, `from_name()`, that accepts a string and queries `Sesame 
<http://cds.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/Sesame>`_ to retrieve coordinates for
that object::

    >>> c = coord.ICRSCoordinates.from_name("M42")
    >>> c.ra, c.dec
    (<RA 83.82208 deg>, <Dec -5.39111 deg>)

This works for any subclass of `~astropy.coordinates.coordsystems.SphericalCoordinatesBase`::
    
    >>> c = coord.GalacticCoordinates.from_name("M42")
    >>> c.l, c.b
    (<Angle -150.98622 deg>, <Angle -19.38162 deg>)

.. note::
    
    This is intended to be a convenience, and is very simple. If you
    need precise coordinates for an object you should find the appropriate 
    reference for that measurement and input the coordinates manually.

In addition, another resource for the capabilities of this package is the
`astropy.coordinates.tests.test_api` testing file. It showcases most of the
major capabilities of the package, and hence is a useful supplement to this
document.  You can see it by either looking at it directly if you downloaded a
copy of the astropy source code, or typing the following in an IPython session::

    In [1]: from astropy.coordinates.tests import test_api
    In [2]: test_api??
