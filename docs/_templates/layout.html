{# This extension of the 'layout.html' is useful if the docs
   are built and hosted on readthedocs.org

   The readthedocs app passes additional variables to the template context.

   The variable 'version_slug' passed by the RTD app  is a string computed
   from the version control tags. It can be 'latest', 'stable' or the
   version number as a string.

   Check out '/readthedocs/builds/version_slug.py' in 'github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org'

{% extends "!layout.html" %}
{%- block extrahead %} 
  {% if version_slug != "stable" or version_slug != "latest"  %}
  <meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">
  {% endif %}
  {{ super()  }}
