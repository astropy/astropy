===========================
astropy.table documentation
===========================

`astropy.table` is a Python package to store and manipulate heterogenous tables of data.

This package allows for access and modification of table data in a
way that is familiar to NumPy users.  A key enhancement provided by the |Table|
class is the ability to easily modify the structure of the table by adding
or removing columns, or adding new rows of data.

Future development is expected to include table joins, merges, and other useful
high-level functionality.
