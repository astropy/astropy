Astrostatistics Tools (`astropy.stats`)
***************************************

Introduction
============

The `astropy.stats` package holds statsitical functions or algorithms used
in astronomy and astropy.


Getting Started
===============

The current tools are fairly self-contained, and include relevant examples in
their docstrings.  For example, see `~astropy.tools.misc.sigma_clip`.



.. NOTE TO FUTURE DEVS: When this subpackage gets more populated, it will be
.. wise to add a section of the form shown below.  Be sure to move this file
.. to docs/tools/index.rst and update docs/index.rst to tools/index when
.. that happens.

.. Using packagename
.. -----------------

.. For more complicated packages that require multiple documents, this
.. should just be a table of contents referencing those documents:

.. .. toctree::
..     packagename/subdoc1
..     packagename/subdoc2
..     packagename/subdoc3


See Also
========

* :mod:`scipy.stats`
    This scipy package contains a variety of useful statistical functions and
    classes.  The functionality in `astropy.stats` is intended to supplement
    this, *not* replace it.
