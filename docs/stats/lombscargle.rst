Lomb-Scargle Periodograms
*************************

The Lomb-Scargle Periodogram (after Lomb [1]_, and Scargle [2]_)
is a commonly-used statistical tool designed to detect periodic signals
in unevenly-spaced observations.
The :class:`~astropy.stats.LombScargle` class is a unified interface to several
implementations of the Lomb-Scargle periodogram, including a fast *O[NlogN]*
implementation following the algorithm presented by Press & Rybicki [3]_.

The code here is adapted from the `astroml`_ package ([4]_, [5]_) and the `gatspy`_ package ([6]_, [7]_).

Basic Usage
===========

.. Note::
   All frequencies in :class:`~astropy.stats.LombScargle` are **not** angular
   frequencies, but rather frequencies of oscillation; i.e. number of
   cycles per unit time.

The Lomb-Scargle periodogram is designed to detect periodic signals in
unevenly-spaced observations. For example, consider the following data:

>>> import numpy as np
>>> rand = np.random.RandomState(42)
>>> t = 100 * rand.rand(100)
>>> y = np.sin(2 * np.pi * t) + 0.1 * rand.randn(100)

These are 100 noisy measurements taken at irregular times, with a frequency
of 1 cycle per unit time.
The Lomb-Scargle periodogram, evaluated at frequencies chosen
automatically based on the input data, can be computed as follows
using the :class:`~astropy.stats.LombScargle` class:

>>> from astropy.stats import LombScargle
>>> frequency, power = LombScargle(t, y).autopower()

Plotting the result with matplotlib gives:

>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # doctest: +SKIP
>>> plt.plot(frequency, power)       # doctest: +SKIP

.. plot::

    from astropy.stats import LombScargle

    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    plt.style.use('ggplot')

    rand = np.random.RandomState(42)
    t = 100 * rand.rand(100)
    y = np.sin(2 * np.pi * t) + 0.1 * rand.randn(100)

    frequency, power = LombScargle(t, y).autopower()
    fig = plt.figure(figsize=(6, 4.5))
    plt.plot(frequency, power)

The periodogram shows a clear spike at a frequency of 1 cycle per unit time,
as we would expect from the data we constructed.

Measurement Uncertainties
-------------------------

The :class:`~astropy.stats.LombScargle` interface can also handle data with
measurement uncertainties.
For example, if all uncertainties are the same, you can pass a scalar:

>>> dy = 0.1
>>> frequency, power = LombScargle(t, y, dy).autopower()

If uncertainties vary from observation to observation, you can pass them as
an array:

>>> dy = 0.1 * (1 + rand.rand(100))
>>> y = np.sin(2 * np.pi * t) + dy * rand.randn(100)
>>> frequency, power = LombScargle(t, y, dy).autopower()

Gaussian uncertainties are assumed, and ``dy`` here specifies the standard
deviation (not the variance).

Periodograms and Units
----------------------
The :class:`~astropy.stats.LombScargle` interface properly handles
:class:`~astropy.units.Quantity` objects with units attached,
and will validate the inputs to make sure units are appropriate. For example:

>>> import astropy.units as u
>>> t_days = t * u.day
>>> y_mags = y * u.mag
>>> dy_mags = y * u.mag
>>> frequency, power = LombScargle(t_days, y_mags, dy_mags).autopower()
>>> frequency.unit
Unit("1 / d")
>>> power.unit
Unit(dimensionless)

We see that the output is dimensionless, which is always the case for the
standard normalized periodogram (for more on normalizations,
see :ref:`lomb-scargle-normalization` below).


Specifying the Frequency
------------------------
With the :func:`~astropy.stats.LombScargle.autopower` method used above,
a heuristic is applied to select
a suitable frequency grid. By default, the heuristic assumes that the width of
peaks is inversely proportional to the observation baseline, and that the
maximum frequency is a factor of 5 larger than the so-called "average Nyquist
frequency", computed based on the average observation spacing.

This heuristic is not universally useful, as the frequencies probed by
irregularly-sampled data can be much higher than the average Nyquist frequency.
For this reason, the heuristic can be tuned through keywords passed to the
:func:`~astropy.stats.LombScargle.autopower` method. For example:

>>> frequency, power = LombScargle(t, y, dy).autopower(nyquist_factor=2)
>>> len(frequency), frequency.min(), frequency.max()
(500, 0.0010189890448009111, 1.0179700557561102)

Here the highest frequency is two times the average Nyquist frequency.
If we increase the ``nyquist_factor``, we can probe higher frequencies:

>>> frequency, power = LombScargle(t, y, dy).autopower(nyquist_factor=10)
>>> len(frequency), frequency.min(), frequency.max()
(2500, 0.0010189890448009111, 5.0939262349597545)

Alternatively, we can use the :func:`~astropy.stats.LombScargle.power`
method to evaluate the periodogram at a user-specified set of frequencies:

>>> frequency = np.linspace(0.5, 1.5, 1000)
>>> power = LombScargle(t, y, dy).power(frequency)

Note that the fastest Lomb-Scargle implementation requires regularly-spaced
frequencies; if frequencies are irregularly-spaced, a slower method will be
used instead.

Frequency Grid Spacing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

One common issue with user-specified frequencies is inadvertently choosing
too coarse a grid, such that significant peaks lie between grid points and
are missed entirely.

For example, imagine you chose to evaluate your periodogram at 100 points:

>>> frequency = np.linspace(0.1, 1.9, 100)
>>> power = LombScargle(t, y, dy).power(frequency)
>>> plt.plot(frequency, power)   # doctest: +SKIP

.. plot::

    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from astropy.stats import LombScargle

    rand = np.random.RandomState(42)
    t = 100 * rand.rand(100)
    dy = 0.1
    y = np.sin(2 * np.pi * t) + dy * rand.randn(100)

    frequency = np.linspace(0.1, 1.9, 100)
    power = LombScargle(t, y, dy).power(frequency)

    plt.style.use('ggplot')
    plt.figure(figsize=(6, 4.5))
    plt.plot(frequency, power)
    plt.xlabel('frequency')
    plt.ylabel('Lomb-Scargle Power')
    plt.ylim(0, 1)

From this plot alone, one might conclude that no clear periodic signal exists
in the data.
But this conclusion is in error: there is in fact a strong periodic signal,
but the periodogram peak falls in the gap between the chosen grid points!

A safer approach is to use the frequency heuristic to decide on the appropriate
grid spacing to use, optionally passing a minimum and maximum frequency to
the :func:`~astropy.stats.LombScargle.autopower` method:

>>> frequency, power = LombScargle(t, y, dy).autopower(minimum_frequency=0.1,
...                                                    maximum_frequency=1.9)
>>> len(frequency)
884
>>> plt.plot(frequency, power)   # doctest: +SKIP

.. plot::

    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from astropy.stats import LombScargle

    rand = np.random.RandomState(42)
    t = 100 * rand.rand(100)
    dy = 0.1
    y = np.sin(2 * np.pi * t) + dy * rand.randn(100)

    frequency, power = LombScargle(t, y, dy).autopower(minimum_frequency=0.1,
                                                       maximum_frequency=1.9)

    plt.style.use('ggplot')
    plt.figure(figsize=(6, 4.5))
    plt.plot(frequency, power)
    plt.xlabel('frequency')
    plt.ylabel('Lomb-Scargle Power')
    plt.ylim(0, 1)

With a finer grid (here 884 points between 0.1 and 1.9),
it is clear that there is a very strong periodic signal in the data.

By default, the heuristic aims to have roughly five grid points across each
significant periodogram peak; this can be increased by changing the
``samples_per_peak`` argument:

>>> frequency, power = LombScargle(t, y, dy).autopower(minimum_frequency=0.1,
...                                                    maximum_frequency=1.9,
...                                                    samples_per_peak=10)
>>> len(frequency)
1767

Keep in mind that the width of the peak scales inversely with the baseline of
the observations (i.e. the difference between the maximum and minimum time),
and the required number of grid points will scale linearly with the size of
the baseline.

The Lomb-Scargle Model
----------------------
Under the hood, the Lomb-Scargle periodogram essentially fits a sinusoidal
model to the data at each frequency, with a larger power reflecting a better
fit. With this in mind, it is often helpful to plot the best-fit sinusoid
over the phased data.

This best-fit sinusoid can be computed using the :func:`~astropy.stats.LombScargle.model` method of the :class:`~astropy.stats.LombScargle` object:

>>> best_frequency = frequency[np.argmax(power)]
>>> t_fit = np.linspace(0, 1)
>>> y_fit = LombScargle(t, y, dy).model(t_fit, best_frequency)

We can then phase the data and plot the Lomb-Scargle model fit:

.. plot::

    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    plt.style.use('ggplot')

    from astropy.stats import LombScargle

    rand = np.random.RandomState(42)
    t = 100 * rand.rand(100)
    dy = 0.1
    y = np.sin(2 * np.pi * t) + dy * rand.randn(100)

    frequency, power = LombScargle(t, y, dy).autopower(minimum_frequency=0.1,
                                                       maximum_frequency=1.9)
    best_frequency = frequency[np.argmax(power)]
    phase_fit = np.linspace(0, 1)
    y_fit = LombScargle(t, y, dy).model(t=phase_fit / best_frequency,
                                        frequency=best_frequency)
    phase = (t * best_frequency) % 1

    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 4.5))
    ax.errorbar(phase, y, dy, fmt='o', mew=0, capsize=0, elinewidth=1.5)
    ax.plot(phase_fit, y_fit, color='black')
    ax.invert_yaxis()
    ax.set(xlabel='phase',
           ylabel='magnitude',
           title='phased data at frequency={0:.2f}'.format(best_frequency))

Additional Arguments
--------------------
On initialization, :class:`~astropy.stats.LombScargle` takes a few additional
arguments which control the model for the data:

- ``center_data`` (``True`` by default) controls whether the ``y`` values are
  pre-centered before the algorithm fits the data.
  The only time it is really warranted to change the default
  is if you are computing the periodogram of a sequence
  of constant values to, e.g. estimate the window power spectrum for a series of
  observations.
- ``fit_mean`` (``True`` by default) controls whether the model fits for the
  mean of the data, rather than assuming the mean is zero. When ``fit_mean=True``,
  the periodogram is more robust than the original Lomb-Scargle formalism,
  particularly in the case of smaller sample sizes and/or
  data with nontrivial selection bias. In the literature, this model has
  variously been called the *date-compensated discrete Fourier transform*,
  the *floating-mean periodogram*, the  *generalized Lomb-Scargle method*,
  and likely other names as well.
- ``nterms`` (``1`` by default) controls how many Fourier terms are used in the
  model. As seen above, the standard Lomb-Scargle periodogram is equivalent to
  a single-term sinusoidal fit to the data at each frequency; the obvious
  generalization is to expand this to a truncated Fourier series with multiple
  frequencies. While this can be very useful in some cases, in others the
  additional model complexity can lead to spurious periodogram peaks that
  outweigh the benefit of the more flexible model.

.. _lomb-scargle-normalization:

Periodogram Normalizations
==========================
There are several normalizations of the Lomb-Scargle periodogram found in the
literature. :class:`~astropy.stats.LombScargle` makes four options available,
via the ``normalization`` argument: ``normalization='standard'``
(the default), ``normalization='model'``, ``normalization='log'``,
and ``normalization='psd'``.
These normalizations are easiest to discuss in terms of least-squares fits around
a constant reference model :math:`M_{ref}` and a periodic model :math:`M(f)` at
each frequency, with best-fit sum-of-residuals that we'll denote by
:math:`\chi^2_{ref}` and :math:`\chi^2(f)` respectively.

Standard Normalization
----------------------
The default, the standard normalized periodogram, is normalized by the residuals
of the data around the constant reference model:

.. math::

   P_{standard}(f) = \frac{\chi^2_{ref} - \chi^2(f)}{\chi^2_{ref}}

This form of the normalization (``normalization='standard'``) is the default
choice used in :class:`~astropy.stats.LombScargle`.
The resulting power *P* is a dimensionless quantity that lies in the
range *0 ≤ P ≤ 1*.

Model Normalization
-------------------
Alternatively, the periodogram is sometimes normalized instead by the residuals
around the periodic model:

.. math::

   P_{model}(f) = \frac{\chi^2_{ref} - \chi^2(f)}{\chi^2(f)}

This form of the normalization can be specified with ``normalization='model'``.
As above, the resulting power is a dimensionless
quantity that lies in the range *0 ≤ P ≤ 1*.

Logarithmic Normalization
-------------------------
Another form of normalization is to scale the periodogram logarithmically:

.. math::

   P_{log}(f) = \log \frac{\chi^2_{ref}}{\chi^2(f)}

This normalization can be specified with ``normalization='log'``, and the
resulting power is a dimensionless quantity in the range *0 ≤ P ≤ ∞*.

PSD Normalization (Unnormalized)
--------------------------------
Finally, it is sometimes useful to compute an unnormalized periodogram
(``normalization='psd'``):

.. math::

   P_{psd}(f) = \frac{N}{2}\left(\chi^2_{ref} - \chi^2(f)\right)

where *N* is the number of data points, which in the no-uncertainty case
will have units ``y.unit ** 2``. This normalization is constructed to be
comparable to the standard Fourier power spectral density (PSD):

>>> ls = LombScargle(t_days, y_mags)
>>> frequency, power = ls.autopower(normalization='psd')
>>> power.unit
Unit("mag2")

Note, however, that the ``normalization='psd'`` result only has these units
*if uncertainties are not specified*. In the presence of uncertainties,
even the unnormalized PSD periodogram will be dimensionless; this is due to
the scaling of data by uncertainty within the Lomb-Scargle computation:

>>> # with uncertainties, PSD power is unitless
>>> ls = LombScargle(t_days, y_mags, dy_mags)
>>> frequency, power = ls.autopower(normalization='psd')
>>> power.unit
Unit(dimensionless)

The equivalence of the PSD-normalized periodogram and the Fourier PSD
in the unnormalized, no-uncertainty case can be confirmed by comparing
results directly for uniformly-sampled inputs.
We will first define a convenience function to compute the basic
Fourier periodogram for uniformly-sampled quantities:

>>> def fourier_periodogram(t, y):
...     N = len(t)
...     frequency = np.fft.fftfreq(N, t[1] - t[0])
...     y_fft = np.fft.fft(y.value) * y.unit
...     positive = (frequency > 0)
...     return frequency[positive], (1. / N) * abs(y_fft[positive]) ** 2

Next we compute the two versions of the PSD from uniformly-sampled data:

>>> t_days = np.arange(100) * u.day
>>> y_mags = rand.randn(100) * u.mag
>>> frequency, PSD_fourier = fourier_periodogram(t_days, y_mags)
>>> PSD_LS = LombScargle(t_days, y_mags).power(frequency, normalization='psd')

Examining the results, we see that the two outputs match:

>>> from astropy.tests.helper import quantity_allclose
>>> quantity_allclose(PSD_fourier, PSD_LS)
True

This equivalence is one reason the Lomb-Scargle periodogram is considered
to be an extension of the Fourier PSD.

For more information on the statistical properties of these normalizations,
see e.g. Baluev 2008 [8]_.


Periodogram Algorithms
======================
The :class:`~astropy.stats.LombScargle` class makes available
several complementary implementations of the Lomb-Scargle Periodogram,
which can be selected using the ``method`` keyword of the Lomb-Scargle power.
By design all methods will return the same results (some approximate),
and each has its advantages and disadvantages.

For example, to compute a periodogram using the fast chi-square method
of Palmer (2009) [9]_, you can specify ``method='fastchi2'``:

    >>> frequency, power = LombScargle(t, y).autopower(method='fastchi2')

There are currently six methods available in the package:

``method='auto'``
-----------------
The ``auto`` method is the default, and will attempt to select the best option
from the following methods using heuristics driven by the input data.

``method='slow'``
-----------------
The ``slow`` method is a pure-Python implementation of the original Lomb-Scargle
periodogram ([1]_, [2]_), enhanced to account for observational noise,
and to allow a floating mean (sometimes called the *generalized periodogram*;
see e.g. [10]_). The method is not particularly fast, scaling approximately
as :math:`O[NM]` for :math:`N` data points and :math:`M` frequencies.

``method='cython'``
-------------------
The ``cython`` method is a cython implementation of the same algorithm used for
``method='slow'``. It is slightly faster than the pure-python implementation,
but much more memory-efficient as the size of the inputs grow. The computational
scaling is approximately :math:`O[NM]` for :math:`N` data points and
:math:`M` frequencies.

``method='scipy'``
------------------
The ``scipy`` method wraps the C implementation of the original Lomb-Scargle
periodogram which is available in :func:`scipy.signal.lombscargle`. This is
slightly faster than the ``slow`` method, but does not allow for errors in
data or extensions such as the floating mean. The scaling is approximately
:math:`O[NM]` for :math:`N` data points and :math:`M` frequencies.

``method='fast'``
-----------------
The ``fast`` method is a pure-Python implementation of the fast periodogram of
Press & Rybicki [3]_. It uses an *extirpolation* approach to approximate
the periodogram frequencies using a fast Fourier transform. As with the
``slow`` method, it can handle data errors and floating mean.
The scaling is approximately :math:`O[N\log M]` for :math:`N`
data points and :math:`M` frequencies.

``method='chi2'``
-----------------
The ``chi2`` method is a pure-Python implementation based on matrix algebra
(see, e.g. [7]_). It utilizes the fact that the Lomb-Scargle periodogram at
each frequency is equivalent to the least-squares fit of a sinusoid to the
data. The advantage of the ``chi2`` method is that it allows extensions of
the periodogram to multiple Fourier terms, specified by the ``nterms``
parameter. For the standard problem, it is slightly slower than
``method='slow'`` and scales as :math:`O[n_fNM]` for :math:`N` data points,
:math:`M` frequencies, and :math:`n_f` Fourier terms.

``method='fastchi2'``
---------------------
The fast chi-squared method of Palmer (2009) [9]_ is equivalent to the ``chi2`` method,
but the matrices are constructed using an FFT-based approach similar to that
of the ``fast`` method. The result is a relatively efficient periodogram
(though not nearly as efficient as the ``fast`` method) which can be extended
to multiple terms. The scaling is approximately :math:`O[n_f(M + N\log M)]`
for :math:`N` data points, :math:`M` frequencies, and :math:`n_f` Fourier terms.

RR-Lyrae Example
================

An example of computing the periodogram for a more realistic dataset is
shown in the following figure. The data here consist of
50 nightly observations of a simulated RR Lyrae-like variable star,
with lightcurve shape that is more complicated than a simple sine wave:

.. plot::

    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    plt.style.use('ggplot')

    from astropy.stats import LombScargle


    def simulated_data(N, rseed=2, period=0.41, phase=0.0):

                  -0.0686, 0.0307, -0.0045, -0.0421, 0.0216, 0.0041]

        rand = np.random.RandomState(rseed)
        t = phase + np.arange(N, dtype=float)
        t += 0.1 * rand.randn(N)
        dmag = 0.01 + 0.03 * rand.rand(N)

        omega = 2 * np.pi / period
        n = np.arange(1 + len(coeffs) // 2)[:, None]

        mag = (15 + dmag * rand.randn(N)
               + np.dot(coeffs[::2], np.cos(n * omega * t)) +
               + np.dot(coeffs[1::2], np.sin(n[1:] * omega * t)))

        return t, mag, dmag


    # generate data and compute the periodogram
    t, mag, dmag = simulated_data(50)
    freq, PLS = LombScargle(t, mag, dmag).autopower(minimum_frequency=1 / 1.2,
                                                    maximum_frequency=1 / 0.2)
    best_freq = freq[np.argmax(PLS)]
    phase = (t * best_freq) % 1

    # compute the best-fit model

    mag_fit = LombScargle(t, mag, dmag).model(t=phase_fit / best_freq,
                                              frequency=best_freq)

    # set up the figure & axes for plotting
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 5))
    fig.suptitle('Lomb-Scargle Periodogram (period=0.41 days)')
    fig.subplots_adjust(bottom=0.12, left=0.07, right=0.95)
    inset = fig.add_axes([0.78, 0.56, 0.15, 0.3])

    # plot the raw data
    ax[0].errorbar(t, mag, dmag, fmt='ok', elinewidth=1.5, capsize=0)
    ax[0].invert_yaxis()
    ax[0].set(xlim=(0, 50),
              xlabel='Observation time (days)',
              ylabel='Observed Magnitude')

    # plot the periodogram
    ax[1].plot(1. / freq, PLS)
    ax[1].set(xlabel='period (days)',
              ylabel='Lomb-Scargle Power',
              xlim=(0.2, 1.2),
              ylim=(0, 1));

    # plot the phased data & model in the inset
    inset.errorbar(phase, mag, dmag, fmt='.k', capsize=0)
    inset.plot(phase_fit, mag_fit)
    inset.invert_yaxis()
    inset.set_xlabel('phase')
    inset.set_ylabel('mag')


This example demonstrates that for irregularly-sampled data,
the Lomb-Scargle periodogram can be sensitive to frequencies higher
than the average Nyquist frequency: the above data are sampled at
an average rate of roughly one observation per night, and the periodogram
relatively cleanly reveals the true period of 0.41 days.

Still, the periodogram has many spurious peaks, which are due to several factors:

1. Errors in observations lead to leakage of power from the true peaks.
2. The signal is not a perfect sinusoid, so additional peaks can indicate
   higher-frequency components in the signal.
3. The observations take place only at night, meaning that the survey window
   has non-negligible power at a frequency of 1 cycle per day.
   Thus we expect aliases to
   appear at :math:`f_{\rm alias} = f_{\rm true} + n f_{\rm window}` for integer
   values of :math:`n`. With a true period of 0.41 days and a 1-day signal
   in the observing window, the :math:`n=+1` and :math:`n=-1`
   aliases to lie at periods of 0.29 and 0.69 days, respectively:
   these aliases are prominent in the above plot.

The interaction of these effects means that in practice there is
no absolute guarantee that the highest peak corresponds to the best frequency,
and results must be interpreted carefully.
