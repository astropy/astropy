Impact and Health
#################

The figures on this page give a sense of the level of impact the ``astropy``
codebase has on the astronomy community and research in the field, as well as
the amount of development effort contributed over time (the codebase's "health").
Assessments of The Astropy Project's engagement with the diverse astronomy
community are an equally important but separate consideration and are detailed
in:

- `Astropy community engagement study <https://zenodo.org/records/10603049>`_

- `Astropy diversity, equity and inclusion study <https://astropy-dei.orgmycology.com/>`_

Concerning the codebase, a major positive trend is that citations to ``astropy``,
as a proxy for its usage in research, have been consistently growing since The
Astropy Project was created. However, the amount of developer resources has
remained small, with a limited number of volunteer maintainers met with an
increasing amount of development responsibility. Hence, we welcome any help
that you can give!

First considering the citations, this figure estimates ``astropy``'s usage in
astronomy research by its yearly publication impact, using citations drawn from
the NASA ADS database. The continual growth in citations shows the broad and
increasing usage of ``astropy`` in astronomy and scientific research, as well as
the high impact that contributions to ``astropy`` can have.

|Citation figure|

To next visualize the size of the developer community contributing to the
``astropy`` core library, this figure shows the number of people authoring commits
over time. While each year ``astropy`` is cited more in papers, the amount of
developers and especially those contributing multiple times is modest and
largely static.

|Commits figure|

The workload to maintain ``astropy`` can be traced through the number of issues and
pull requests open and closed in the ``astropy`` core library over time. The
long-term increase in overall pull requests, along with a comparable amount of
opens and closes on average, shows that the small number of maintainers is
increasingly taxed. The discrepancy between issue opens and closes over time
reinforces this.

|Issue PR history figure|

In short, ``astropy`` would greatly benefit from more developers, whose
contributions would reach a significant fraction of research in astronomy. This
figure shows the number of open issues and pull requests for each subpackage in
``astropy``. In addition to indicating which functionalities are used more heavily
by the community at present, it gives a sense of where you could start if
you're interested in contributing to ``astropy``.
