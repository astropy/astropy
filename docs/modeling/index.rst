Models and Fitting (`astropy.modeling`)
***************************************

Introduction
============

`astropy.modeling` provides a framework for representing models and performing
model evaluation and fitting.  A number of predefined 1-D and 2-D models are
provided and the capability for custom, user defined models is supported.
Different fitting algorithms can be used with any model.  For those fitters
with the capabilities fitting can be done using uncertainties, parameters with
bounds, and priors.

A Simple Example
================

This simple example illustrates defining a model,
calculating values based on input x values, and using fitting data with a model.

   .. plot::
       :include-source:

       import numpy as np
       import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
       from astropy.modeling import models, fitting

       # define a model for a line
       line_orig = models.Linear1D(slope=1.0, intercept=0.5)

       # generate x, y data non-uniformly spaced in x
       # add noise to y measurements
       npts = 30
       rng = np.random.default_rng(10)
       x = rng.uniform(0.0, 10.0, npts)
       y = line_orig(x)
       y += rng.normal(0.0, 1.5, npts)

       # initialize a linear fitter
       fit = fitting.LinearLSQFitter()

       # initialize a linear model
       line_init = models.Linear1D()

       # fit the data with the fitter
       fitted_line = fit(line_init, x, y)

       # plot the model
       plt.figure()
       plt.plot(x, y, 'ko', label='Data')
       plt.plot(x, fitted_line(x), 'k-', label='Fitted Model')
       plt.xlabel('x')
       plt.ylabel('y')
       plt.legend()
