Physical Models
***************

These are models that are physics motivated (as opposed to mathematically motivated).

BlackBody
=========

The :class:`~astropy.modeling.physical_models.BlackBody` model is the bee's knees!
Details and an example needed.

.. note::

    Prior to v4.0, the BlackBody1D and the functions blackbody_nu and blackbody_lambda
    were provided.  BlackBody1D was a more limited blackbody model that was
    specific to integrated fluxes from sources.  The capabilites of all three
    can be obtained with :class:`~astropy.modeling.physical_models.BlackBody`.
    See :doc:`blackbody_deprecated` for details.
