# This file exists because as of 2022, GitHub does not offer a mechanism to subscribe to only
# a fraction of new PRs in astropy. Either one chooses to "watch" the entire repository and
# receives a large number of notifications or one needs to manually check for new PRs for
# sub-package(s) of interest.
#
# All names listed here by sub-packages will be requested to review any new PR
# and thus get notified. Only people with maintainer-level permission can be added as
# PR reviewers.
