Contributing to Astropy
=======================

Reporting Issues
----------------

When opening an issue to report a problem, please try to provide a minimal code
example that reproduces the issue along with details of the operating
system and the Python, NumPy, and `astropy` versions you are using.

Contributing Code and Documentation
-----------------------------------

So you are interested in contributing to the Astropy Project?  Excellent!
We love contributions! Astropy is open source, built on open source, and
we'd love to have you hang out in our community.

Anti Imposter Syndrome Reassurance
----------------------------------

We want your help. No, really.

There may be a little voice inside your head that is telling you that you're not
ready to be an open source contributor; that your skills aren't nearly good
enough to contribute. What could you possibly offer a project like this one?

We assure you - the little voice in your head is wrong. If you can write code or
documentation, you can contribute code to open source.
Contributing to open source projects is a fantastic way to advance one's coding
and open source workflow skills. Writing perfect code isn't the measure of a good
developer (that would disqualify all of us!); it's trying to create something,
making mistakes, and learning from those mistakes. That's how we all improve,
and we are happy to help others learn.

Being an open source contributor doesn't just mean writing code, either. You can
help out by writing documentation, tests, or even giving feedback about the
project (and yes - that includes giving feedback about the contribution
process). Some of these contributions may be the most valuable to the project as
a whole, because you're coming to the project with fresh eyes, so you can see
the errors and assumptions that seasoned contributors have glossed over.

[Adrienne Lowe](https://github.com/adriennefriend) for a
[PyCon talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Uj746j9Heo), and was adapted by
Astropy based on its use in the README file for the
[MetPy project](https://github.com/Unidata/MetPy).

How to Contribute, Best Practices
---------------------------------

Most contributions to Astropy are done via [pull
requests](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
from GitHub users' forks of the [astropy
repository](https://github.com/astropy/astropy). If you are new to this
style of development, you will want to read over our [development
workflow](https://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/development/workflow/development_workflow.html).

You may also/instead be interested in contributing to an
[astropy affiliated package](https://www.astropy.org/affiliated/).
Affiliated packages are astronomy-related software packages that are not a part
of the `astropy` core package, but build on it for more specialized applications
and follow the Astropy guidelines for reuse, interoperability, and interfacing.
Each affiliated package has its own developers/maintainers and its own specific
guidelines for contributions, so be sure to read their docs.

Once you open a pull request (which should be opened against the ``main``
branch, not against any of the other branches), please make sure to
include the following:

- **Code**: the code you are adding, which should follow
  our [coding guidelines](https://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/development/codeguide.html) as much as possible.

- **Tests**: these are usually tests to ensure code that previously
  failed now works (regression tests), or tests that cover as much as possible
  of the new functionality to make sure it does not break in the future and
  also returns consistent results on all platforms (since we run these tests on
  many platforms/configurations). For more information about how to write
  tests, see our [testing guidelines](https://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/development/testguide.html).

- **Documentation**: if you are adding new functionality, be sure to include a
  description in the main documentation (in ``docs/``). Again, we have some
  detailed [documentation guidelines](https://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/development/docguide.html) to help you out.

- **Performance improvements**: if you are making changes that impact `astropy`
  performance, consider adding a performance benchmark in the
  [astropy-benchmarks](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-benchmarks)
  repository. You can find out more about how to do this
  [in the README for that repository](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-benchmarks#contributing-benchmarks).

- **Changelog entry**: whether you are fixing a bug or adding new
  functionality, you should add a changelog fragment in the ``docs/changes/``
  directory. See ``docs/changes/README.rst`` for some guidance on the creation
  of this file.

  If you are opening a pull request you may not know
  the PR number yet, but you can add it once the pull request is open. If you
  are not sure where to put the changelog entry, wait until a maintainer
  has reviewed your PR and assigned it to a milestone.

  You do not need to include a changelog entry for fixes to bugs introduced in
  the developer version and therefore are not present in the stable releases. In
  general you do not need to include a changelog entry for minor documentation
  or test updates. Only user-visible changes (new features/API changes, fixed
  issues) need to be mentioned. If in doubt, ask the core maintainer reviewing
  your changes.

Checklist for Contributed Code
------------------------------

Before being merged, a pull request for a new feature will be reviewed to see if
it meets the following requirements. If you are unsure about how to meet all of these
requirements, please submit the PR and ask for help and/or guidance. An Astropy
maintainer will collaborate with you to make sure that the pull request meets the
requirements for inclusion in the package:

**Scientific Quality** (when applicable)
  * Is the submission relevant to astronomy?
  * Are references included to the origin source for the algorithm?
  * Does the code perform as expected?
  * Has the code been tested against previously existing implementations?

**Code Quality**
  * Are the [coding guidelines](https://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/development/codeguide.html) followed?
  * Is the code compatible with the supported versions of Python (see [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/astropy/astropy/blob/main/pyproject.toml))?
  * Are there dependencies other than the run-time dependencies listed in pyproject.toml?
    * Is the package importable even if the C-extensions are not built?
    * Are additional dependencies handled appropriately?
    * Do functions that require additional dependencies raise an `ImportError`
      if they are not present?

  * Are the sources for the tests documented?
  * Have tests that require an [optional dependency](https://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/development/testguide.html#tests-requiring-optional-dependencies)
    been marked as such?
  * Does ``tox -e test`` run without failures?

**Documentation**
  * Are the [documentation guidelines](https://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/development/docguide.html) followed?

    * What the code does?
    * The format of the inputs of the function?
    * The format of the outputs of the function?
    * References to the original algorithms?
    * Any exceptions which are raised?
    * An example of running the code?
  * Is there any information needed to be added to the docs to describe the
    function?
  * Does the documentation build without errors or warnings?

**License**
  * Is the `astropy` license included at the top of the file?
  * Are there any conflicts with this code and existing codes?

**Astropy requirements**
  * Do all the GitHub Actions and CircleCI tests pass? If not, are they allowed to fail?
  * If applicable, has an entry been added into the changelog?
  * Can you check out the pull request and repeat the examples and tests?

Other Tips
----------

- Behind the scenes, we conduct a number of tests or checks with new pull requests.
  This is a technique that is called continuous integration, and we use GitHub Actions
  and CircleCI. To prevent the automated tests from running, you can add ``[ci skip]``
  to your commit message. This is useful if your PR is a work in progress (WIP) and
  you are not yet ready for the tests to run. For example:

      $ git commit -m "WIP widget [ci skip]"

  - If you already made the commit without including this string, you can edit
    your existing commit message by running:

        $ git commit --amend

- If your commit makes substantial changes to the documentation but none of
  those changes include code snippets, then you can use ``[ci skip]``,
  which will skip all CI except RTD, where the documentation is built.

- When contributing trivial documentation fixes (i.e., fixes to typos, spelling,
  grammar) that don't contain any special markup and are not associated with
  code changes, please include the string ``[ci skip]`` in your commit
  message.

      $ git commit -m "Fixed typo [ci skip]"

- ``[ci skip]`` and ``[skip ci]`` are the same and can be used interchangeably.
