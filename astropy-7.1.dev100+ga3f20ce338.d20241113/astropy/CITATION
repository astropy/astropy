If you use Astropy Project tools and resources for work/research presented in a
publication (whether directly, or as a dependency to another package), we ask that you
please cite the Astropy papers. We encourage you to cite all three papers, but if space
is limited, please cite the most recent paper.

If publishing in the AAS Journals, we recommend adding a \software{} tag to your LaTeX manuscript with

  \software{Astropy \citep{astropy:2013, astropy:2018, astropy:2022}}

where the citation keys refer to the Astropy papers:

  https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013A%26A...558A..33A
  https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AJ....156..123A
  https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...935..167A

and BibTeX records are provided below.

For other journals or publication mechanisms, we recommend adding an acknowledgment:

  This work made use of Astropy: a community-developed core Python package and an
  ecosystem of tools and resources for astronomy (Astropy Collaboration, 2013, 2018,
  2022).

where (Astropy Collaboration, 2013, 2018, 2022) represents citations to the Astropy
papers linked above.

We encourage you to also include citations to the papers in the main text wherever
appropriate.

The recommended LaTeX acknowledgment is:

  This work made use of Astropy: a community-developed core Python package and an
  ecosystem of tools and resources for astronomy \citep{astropy:2013, astropy:2018,
  astropy:2022}.

BibTeX entries for the above citations are:
