# The C-based XML parser for VOTables previously used fixed-sized
# buffers (allocated at __init__() time).  This test will
# only pass with the patch that allows a dynamic realloc() of
# the queue.  This addresses the bugs:
#
# - "RuntimeError: XML queue overflow"
#   https://github.com/astropy/astropy/issues/5824
#   (Kudos to Stefan Becker---ARI/ZAH Heidelberg)
#
# - "iterparse.c: add queue_realloc() + move 'buffersize / 2' logic there"
#   https://github.com/astropy/astropy/issues/5869
#
# This test code can emulate a combination of network buffering and
# gzip decompression---with different request sizes, it can be used to
# demonstrate both under-reading and over-reading.
#
# Using the 512-tag VOTABLE XML sample input, and various combinations
# of minimum/maximum fetch sizes, the following situations can be
# generated:
#
# maximum_fetch =  1 (ValueError, no element found) still within gzip headers
# maximum_fetch = 80 (ValueError, unclosed token) short read
# maximum_fetch =217 passes, because decompressed_length > requested
#                            && <512 tags in a single parse
# maximum_fetch =218 (RuntimeError, XML queue overflow)
#
# The test provided here covers the over-reading identified in #5824
# (equivalent to the 217).

# Firstly, assemble a minimal VOTABLE header, table contents and footer.
# This is done in textual form, as the aim is to only test the parser, not
# the outputter!

# minimum passable buffer size => 1024
# 1024 / 2 => 512 tags for overflow
# 512 - 7 tags in header, - 5 tags in footer = 500 tags required for overflow
# 500 / 4 tags (<tr><td></td></tr>) per row == 125 rows required for overflow

# UngzipFileWrapper() wraps an existing file-like Object,
# decompressing the content and returning the plaintext.
# This therefore emulates the behavior of the Python 'requests'
# library when transparently decompressing Gzip HTTP responses.
#
# The critical behavior is that---because of the
# decompression---read() can return considerably more
# bytes than were requested!  (But, read() can also return less).

# read() method emulation that always returned more from a buffer
# that was requested.
