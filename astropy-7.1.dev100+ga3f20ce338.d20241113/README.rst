Developing with Codespaces
==========================

GitHub Codespaces is a cloud development environment using Visual Studio Code
in your browser. This is a convenient way to start developing Astropy, using
our `dev container <.devcontainer/devcontainer.json>`_ configured
with the required packages. For help, see the `GitHub Codespaces
docs <https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces>`_.
