The ``format_exponential_notation()`` method of the ``Base`` unit formatter has
changed.
Any unit formatters that inherit directly from ``Base`` but have not
implemented their own ``format_exponential_notation()`` and wish to retain
previous behavior should implement it as:

.. code-block:: python

    def format_exponential_notation(cls, val, format_spec):
        return format(val, format_spec)

Any formatters that inherit directly from ``Base`` and call
``super().format_exponential_notation(val, format_spec)`` should instead call
``format(val, format_spec)``
The specific unit formatters in ``astropy.units`` and custom formatters that
inherit from any of them are not affected.
