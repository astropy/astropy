``Time.ptp`` now properly emits a deprecation warning independently of NumPy's
version. This method was previously deprecated in astropy 6.1, but the warning
was not visible for users that had NumPy 1.x installed. Because of this, the
warning message was updated to state that ``Time.ptp`` is deprecated since
version 7.0 instead.
