Accessing or setting the following attributes on ``CoordinateHelper`` has been deprecated:

* ``ticks``
* ``ticklabels``
* ``axislabels``

Setting the following attributes on ``CoordinateHelper`` directly has been deprecated:

* ``parent_axes``
* ``parent_map``
* ``transform``
* ``coord_index``
* ``coord_unit``
* ``coord_type`` (use ``set_coord_type`` instead)
* ``coord_wrap`` (use ``set_coord_type`` instead)
* ``frame``
* ``default_label``

Accessing or setting the following attributes on ``CoordinateHelper`` has been
removed (without deprecation, as these were clearly internal variables):

* ``grid_lines_kwargs``
* ``grid_lines``
* ``lblinfo``
* ``lbl_world``
* ``minor_frequency`` (there were already public methods to set/get this)
