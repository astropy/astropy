Changed a number of dict-like containers in ``io.ascii`` from ``OrderedDict`` to
``dict``. The ``dict`` class maintains key order since Python 3.8 so ``OrderedDict`` is
no longer needed. The changes are largely internal and should not affect users in any
way. See also the API change log entry for this PR.
