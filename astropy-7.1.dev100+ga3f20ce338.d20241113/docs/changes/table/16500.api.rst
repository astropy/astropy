Always use ``MaskedQuantity`` in ``QTable`` to represent masked ``Quantity``
data or when the ``QTable`` is created with ``masked=True``.  Previously the
default was to use a normal ``Quantity`` with a ``mask`` attribute of type
``FalseArray`` as a stub to allow a minimal level of compatibility for certain
operations. This update brings more consistent behavior and fixes functions
like reading of table data from a list of dict that includes quantities with
missing entries, and aggregation of ``MaskedQuantity`` in table groups.
