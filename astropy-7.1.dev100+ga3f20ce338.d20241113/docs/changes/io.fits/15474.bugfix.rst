Fix a number of bugs in ``CompImageHDU``:

* Fix the ability to pickle ``CompImageHDU`` objects
* Ensure that compression settings are not lost if initializing ``CompImageHDU``
  without data but with compression settings and setting the data later
* Make sure that keywords are properly updated when setting the header of a
  ``CompImageHDU`` to an existing image header.
* Fix the ability to use ``CompImageHDU.section`` on instances that have not yet
  been written to disk
* Fix the image checksum/datasum in ``CompImageHDU.header`` to be those for the
  image HDU instead of for the underlying binary table.
