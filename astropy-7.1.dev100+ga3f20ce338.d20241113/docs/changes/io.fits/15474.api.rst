The ``CompImageHDU`` class has been refactored to inherit from ``ImageHDU``
instead of ``BinTableHDU``. This change should be for the most part preserve the
API, but any calls to ``isinstance(hdu, BinTableHDU)`` will now return ``False``
if ``hdu`` is a ``CompImageHDU`` whereas before it would have returned ``True``.
In addition, the ``uint`` keyword argument to ``CompImageHDU`` now defaults to
``True`` for consistency with ``ImageHDU``.
