Added ``inplace=False/True`` keyword argument to the ``__call__`` method of most fitters,
to optionally allow the original model passed to the fitter to be modified with the fitted
values of the parameters, rather than return a copy. This can improve performance if users
don't need to keep hold of the initial parameter values.
