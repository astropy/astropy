``SkyCoord``, coordinate frames, and representations have all have gained the
ability to deal with ``Masked`` data. In general, the procedure is similar to
that of ``Time``, except that different representation components do not share
the mask, to enable holding, e.g., a catalogue of objects in which only some
have associated distances.
