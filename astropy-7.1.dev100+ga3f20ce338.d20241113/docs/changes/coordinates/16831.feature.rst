``BaseCoordinateFrame`` instances such as ``ICRS``, ``SkyOffsetFrame``, etc.,
can now be stored directly in tables (previously, they were stored as
``object`` type columns). Furthermore, storage in tables is now also possible
for frames that have no data (but which have attributes with the correct shape
to fit in the table).
