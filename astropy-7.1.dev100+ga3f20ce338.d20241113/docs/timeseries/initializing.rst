Creating Time Series
********************

Initializing a Time Series
==========================

The first type of time series that we will look at here is a |TimeSeries|
object, which can be used for a time series which samples a continuous variable
at discrete, instantaneous times. Initializing a |TimeSeries| object can be done
in the same ways as initializing a |Table| object (see :ref:`Data Tables
<astropy-table>`), but additional arguments related to the times should be
specified.

Evenly Sampled Time Series
--------------------------

.. EXAMPLE START: Constructing an Evenly Sampled TimeSeries

The most convenient way to construct an evenly sampled |TimeSeries| is to
specify the start time, the time interval, and the number of samples::

    >>> from astropy import units as u
    >>> from astropy.timeseries import TimeSeries
    >>> ts1 = TimeSeries(time_start='2016-03-22T12:30:31',
    ...                  time_delta=3 * u.s,
    ...                  n_samples=5)
    >>> ts1
    <TimeSeries length=5>
              time
              Time
    -----------------------
    2016-03-22T12:30:31.000
    2016-03-22T12:30:34.000
    2016-03-22T12:30:37.000
    2016-03-22T12:30:40.000
    2016-03-22T12:30:43.000

The ``time`` keyword argument can be set to anything that can be passed to the
|Time| class (see also :ref:`Time and Dates <astropy-time>`) or |Time| objects
directly. Note that the ``n_samples`` argument is only needed if you are not
also passing in data during initialization (see `Passing Data During
Initialization`_).

.. EXAMPLE END

Arbitrarily Sampled Time Series
-------------------------------

.. EXAMPLE START: Constructing an Arbitrarily Sampled TimeSeries

To construct a sampled time series with samples at arbitrary times, you can
pass multiple times to the ``time`` argument::

    >>> ts2 = TimeSeries(time=['2016-03-22T12:30:31',
    ...                        '2016-03-22T12:30:38',
    ...                        '2016-03-22T12:34:40'])
    >>> ts2
    <TimeSeries length=3>
              time
              Time
    -----------------------
    2016-03-22T12:30:31.000
    2016-03-22T12:30:38.000
    2016-03-22T12:34:40.000

You can also specify a vector |Time| object directly as the ``time=`` argument,
or a vector |TimeDelta| argument or a quantity array to the ``time_delta=``
argument.::

    >>> TimeSeries(time_start="2011-01-01T00:00:00",
    ...            time_delta=[0.1, 0.2, 0.1, 0.3, 0.2]*u.s)
    <TimeSeries length=5>
             time
             Time
    -----------------------
    2011-01-01T00:00:00.000
    2011-01-01T00:00:00.100
    2011-01-01T00:00:00.300
    2011-01-01T00:00:00.400
    2011-01-01T00:00:00.700

.. EXAMPLE END

.. _timeseries-binned-initializing:

Initializing a Binned Time Series
=================================

The |BinnedTimeSeries| can be used to represent time series where each entry
corresponds to measurements taken over a range in time â€” for instance, a light
curve constructed by binning X-ray photon events. This class supports equal-size
or uneven bins, and contiguous and non-contiguous bins. As for |TimeSeries|,
initializing a |BinnedTimeSeries| can be done in the same ways as initializing a
|Table| object (see :ref:`Data Tables <astropy-table>`), but additional
arguments related to the times should be specified as described below.

Equal-Sized Contiguous Bins
---------------------------

.. EXAMPLE START: Initializing a Binned Time Series with Equal Contiguous Bins

To create a binned time series with equal-size contiguous bins, it is sufficient
to specify a start time as well as a bin size::

    >>> from astropy.timeseries import BinnedTimeSeries
    >>> ts3 = BinnedTimeSeries(time_bin_start='2016-03-22T12:30:31',
    ...                        time_bin_size=3 * u.s, n_bins=10)
    >>> ts3
    <BinnedTimeSeries length=10>
        time_bin_start     time_bin_size
                                 s
              Time             float64
    ----------------------- -------------
    2016-03-22T12:30:31.000           3.0
    2016-03-22T12:30:34.000           3.0
    2016-03-22T12:30:37.000           3.0
    2016-03-22T12:30:40.000           3.0
    2016-03-22T12:30:43.000           3.0
    2016-03-22T12:30:46.000           3.0
    2016-03-22T12:30:49.000           3.0
    2016-03-22T12:30:52.000           3.0
    2016-03-22T12:30:55.000           3.0
    2016-03-22T12:30:58.000           3.0

Note that the ``n_bins`` argument is only needed if you are not also passing in
data during initialization (see `Passing Data During Initialization`_).

.. EXAMPLE END

Uneven Contiguous Bins
----------------------

.. EXAMPLE START: Initializing a Binned Time Series with Uneven Contiguous Bins

When creating a binned time series with uneven contiguous bins, the bin size can
be changed to give multiple values (note that in this case ``n_bins`` is not
required)::

    >>> ts4 = BinnedTimeSeries(time_bin_start='2016-03-22T12:30:31',
    ...                        time_bin_size=[3, 3, 2, 3] * u.s)
    >>> ts4
    <BinnedTimeSeries length=4>
         time_bin_start     time_bin_size
                                  s
              Time             float64
    ----------------------- -------------
    2016-03-22T12:30:31.000           3.0
    2016-03-22T12:30:34.000           3.0
    2016-03-22T12:30:37.000           2.0
    2016-03-22T12:30:39.000           3.0

Alternatively, you can create the same time series by giving an array of start
times as well as a single end time::

    >>> ts5 = BinnedTimeSeries(time_bin_start=['2016-03-22T12:30:31',
    ...                                        '2016-03-22T12:30:34',
    ...                                        '2016-03-22T12:30:37',
    ...                                        '2016-03-22T12:30:39'],
    ...                        time_bin_end='2016-03-22T12:30:42')
    >>> ts5  # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP
    <BinnedTimeSeries length=4>
         time_bin_start        time_bin_size
                                    s
             Time                float64
    ----------------------- -----------------
    2016-03-22T12:30:31.000               3.0
    2016-03-22T12:30:34.000               3.0
    2016-03-22T12:30:37.000               2.0
    2016-03-22T12:30:39.000               3.0

.. EXAMPLE END

Uneven Non-Contiguous Bins
--------------------------

.. EXAMPLE START: Initializing a Binned Time Series with Uneven Non-Contiguous
   Bins

To create a binned time series with non-contiguous bins, you can either
specify an array of start times and bin widths::

    >>> ts6 = BinnedTimeSeries(time_bin_start=['2016-03-22T12:30:31',
    ...                                        '2016-03-22T12:30:38',
    ...                                        '2016-03-22T12:34:40'],
    ...                        time_bin_size=[5, 100, 2]*u.s)
    >>> ts6
    <BinnedTimeSeries length=3>
         time_bin_start     time_bin_size
                                  s
              Time             float64
    ----------------------- -------------
    2016-03-22T12:30:31.000           5.0
    2016-03-22T12:30:38.000         100.0
    2016-03-22T12:34:40.000           2.0

Or in the most general case, you can also specify multiple times for
``time_bin_start`` and ``time_bin_end``::

    >>> ts7 = BinnedTimeSeries(time_bin_start=['2016-03-22T12:30:31',
    ...                                        '2016-03-22T12:30:33',
    ...                                        '2016-03-22T12:30:40'],
    ...                        time_bin_end=['2016-03-22T12:30:32',
    ...                                      '2016-03-22T12:30:35',
    ...                                      '2016-03-22T12:30:41'])
    >>> ts7  # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP
    <BinnedTimeSeries length=3>
        time_bin_start        time_bin_size
                                    s
              Time               float64

Adding Data to the Time Series
==============================

The above examples show how to initialize |TimeSeries| objects, but these do not
include any data aside from the times. There are different ways of adding data,
as with the |Table| class.

Passing Data During Initialization
----------------------------------

.. EXAMPLE START: Adding Data to a TimeSeries Object During Initialization

It is possible to pass data during the initialization of a |TimeSeries|
object, as for |Table| objects. For instance::

    >>> ts8 = BinnedTimeSeries(time_bin_start=['2016-03-22T12:30:31',
    ...                                        '2016-03-22T12:30:34',
    ...                                        '2016-03-22T12:30:37',
    ...                                        '2016-03-22T12:30:39'],
    ...                        time_bin_end='2016-03-22T12:30:42',
    ...                        data={'flux': [1., 4., 5., 6.] * u.mJy})
    >>> ts8  # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP
    <BinnedTimeSeries length=4>
          time_bin_start     time_bin_size     flux
                                   s            mJy
              Time              float64       float64

    2016-03-22T12:30:34.000               3.0     4.0
    2016-03-22T12:30:37.000               2.0     5.0
    2016-03-22T12:30:39.000               3.0     6.0

.. EXAMPLE END

Adding Data After Initialization
--------------------------------

.. EXAMPLE START: Adding Data to a TimeSeries Object After Initialization

Once a |TimeSeries| object is initialized, you can add columns/fields to it as
you would for a |Table| object::

    >>> from astropy import units as u
    >>> ts1['flux'] = [1., 4., 5., 6., 4.] * u.mJy
    >>> ts1
    <TimeSeries length=5>
              time            flux
                              mJy
              Time          float64
    ----------------------- -------
    2016-03-22T12:30:31.000     1.0
    2016-03-22T12:30:34.000     4.0
    2016-03-22T12:30:37.000     5.0
    2016-03-22T12:30:40.000     6.0
    2016-03-22T12:30:43.000     4.0

.. EXAMPLE END

Adding Rows
-----------

.. EXAMPLE START: Adding Rows to a TimeSeries or BinnedTimeSeries

Adding rows to |TimeSeries| or |BinnedTimeSeries| can be done using the
:meth:`~astropy.table.Table.add_row` method, as for |Table| and |QTable|. This
method takes a dictionary where the keys are column names::

    >>> ts8.add_row({'time_bin_start': '2016-03-22T12:30:44.000',
    ...              'time_bin_size': 2 * u.s,
    ...              'flux': 3 * u.mJy})
    >>> ts8  # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP
    <BinnedTimeSeries length=5>
        time_bin_start       time_bin_size      flux
                                    s           mJy
              Time               float64      float64
    ----------------------- ----------------- -------
    2016-03-22T12:30:31.000               3.0     1.0
    2016-03-22T12:30:34.000               3.0     4.0
    2016-03-22T12:30:37.000               2.0     5.0
    2016-03-22T12:30:39.000               3.0     6.0
    2016-03-22T12:30:44.000               2.0     3.0

If you want to be able to skip some values when adding rows, you should make
sure that masking is enabled â€” see :ref:`timeseries-masking` for more details.
