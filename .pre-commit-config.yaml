  # We list the warnings/errors to check for here rather than in setup.cfg because
  # we don't want these options to apply whenever anyone calls flake8 from the
  # command-line or their code editor - in this case all warnings/errors should be
  # checked for. The warnings/errors we check for here are:
  # E101 - mix of tabs and spaces
  # E111 - 4 spaces per indentation level
  # E112 - 4 spaces per indentation level
  # E113 - 4 spaces per indentation level
  # E201 - whitespace after '('
  # E202 - whitespace before ')'
  # E27 - spaces and tabs after
  # E3 - Blank line
  # E502 - the backslash is redundant between brackets
  # E70 - multiple statements on a line
  # E9 - Runtime
  # F - Flake8 Errors
  # W - Whitespace
