**
**  Form the celestial-to-intermediate matrix for a given date given
**  the bias-precession-nutation matrix.  IAU 2000.
**
**  Given:
**     date1,date2 double       TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
**     rbpn        double[3][3] celestial-to-true matrix (Note 2)
**
**  Returned:
**     rc2i        double[3][3] celestial-to-intermediate matrix (Note 3)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
**     among others:
**
**            date1          date2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  2) The matrix rbpn transforms vectors from GCRS to true equator (and
**     CIO or equinox) of date.  Only the CIP (bottom row) is used.
**
**  3) The matrix rc2i is the first stage in the transformation from
**     celestial to terrestrial coordinates:
**
**        [TRS] = RPOM * R_3(ERA) * rc2i * [CRS]
**
**              = RC2T * [CRS]
**
**     where [CRS] is a vector in the Geocentric Celestial Reference
**     System and [TRS] is a vector in the International Terrestrial
**     Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003), ERA is the Earth
**     Rotation Angle and RPOM is the polar motion matrix.
**
**  4) Although its name does not include "00", This function is in fact
**     specific to the IAU 2000 models.

**     eraBpn2xy    extract CIP X,Y coordinates from NPB matrix
**     eraC2ixy     celestial-to-intermediate matrix, given X,Y
