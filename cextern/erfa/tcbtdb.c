**
**  Time scale transformation:  Barycentric Coordinate Time, TCB, to
**  Barycentric Dynamical Time, TDB.
**
**  Given:
**     tcb1,tcb2  double    TCB as a 2-part Julian Date
**
**  Returned:
**     tdb1,tdb2  double    TDB as a 2-part Julian Date
**
**  Returned (function value):
**                int       status:  0 = OK
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) tcb1+tcb2 is Julian Date, apportioned in any convenient way
**     between the two arguments, for example where tcb1 is the Julian
**     Day Number and tcb2 is the fraction of a day.  The returned
**     tdb1,tdb2 follow suit.
**
**  2) The 2006 IAU General Assembly introduced a conventional linear
**     transformation between TDB and TCB.  This transformation
**     compensates for the drift between TCB and terrestrial time TT,
**     and keeps TDB approximately centered on TT.  Because the
**     relationship between TT and TCB depends on the adopted solar
**     system ephemeris, the degree of alignment between TDB and TT over
**     long intervals will vary according to which ephemeris is used.
**     Former definitions of TDB attempted to avoid this problem by
**     stipulating that TDB and TT should differ only by periodic
**     effects.  This is a good description of the nature of the
**     relationship but eluded precise mathematical formulation.  The
**     conventional linear relationship adopted in 2006 sidestepped
**     these difficulties whilst delivering a TDB that in practice was
**     consistent with values before that date.
**
**  3) TDB is essentially the same as Teph, the time argument for the
**     JPL solar system ephemerides.
