**
**  Time scale transformation:  Universal Time, UT1, to Coordinated
**  Universal Time, UTC.
**
**  Given:
**     ut11,ut12  double   UT1 as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
**     dut1       double   Delta UT1: UT1-UTC in seconds (Note 2)
**
**  Returned:
**     utc1,utc2  double   UTC as a 2-part quasi Julian Date (Notes 3,4)
**
**  Returned (function value):
**                int      status: +1 = dubious year (Note 5)
**                                  0 = OK
**                                 -1 = unacceptable date
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) ut11+ut12 is Julian Date, apportioned in any convenient way
**     between the two arguments, for example where ut11 is the Julian
**     Day Number and ut12 is the fraction of a day.  The returned utc1
**     and utc2 form an analogous pair, except that a special convention
**     is used, to deal with the problem of leap seconds - see Note 3.
**
**  2) Delta UT1 can be obtained from tabulations provided by the
**     International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service.  The
**     value changes abruptly by 1s at a leap second;  however, close to
**     a leap second the algorithm used here is tolerant of the "wrong"
**     choice of value being made.
**
**  3) JD cannot unambiguously represent UTC during a leap second unless
**     special measures are taken.  The convention in the present
**     function is that the returned quasi JD day UTC1+UTC2 represents
**     UTC days whether the length is 86399, 86400 or 86401 SI seconds.
**
**  4) The function eraD2dtf can be used to transform the UTC quasi-JD
**     into calendar date and clock time, including UTC leap second
**     handling.
**
**  5) The warning status "dubious year" flags UTCs that predate the
**     introduction of the time scale or that are too far in the future
**     to be trusted.  See eraDat for further details.
**
**  Called:
**     eraJd2cal    JD to Gregorian calendar
**     eraDat       delta(AT) = TAI-UTC
**     eraCal2jd    Gregorian calendar to JD
