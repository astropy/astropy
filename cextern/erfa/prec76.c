**
**  IAU 1976 precession model.
**
**  This function forms the three Euler angles which implement general
**  precession between two dates, using the IAU 1976 model (as for the
**  FK5 catalog).
**
**  Given:
**     date01,date02   double    TDB starting date (Note 1)
**     date11,date12   double    TDB ending date (Note 1)
**
**  Returned:
**     zeta            double    1st rotation: radians cw around z
**     z               double    3rd rotation: radians cw around z
**     theta           double    2nd rotation: radians ccw around y
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The dates date01+date02 and date11+date12 are Julian Dates,
**     apportioned in any convenient way between the arguments daten1
**     and daten2.  For example, JD(TDB)=2450123.7 could be expressed in
**     any of these ways, among others:
**
**           daten1        daten2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in cases
**     where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
**     acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way the
**     argument is handled internally and will deliver the optimum
**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**     The two dates may be expressed using different methods, but at
**     the risk of losing some resolution.
**
**  2) The accumulated precession angles zeta, z, theta are expressed
**     through canonical polynomials which are valid only for a limited
**     time span.  In addition, the IAU 1976 precession rate is known to
**     be imperfect.  The absolute accuracy of the present formulation
**     is better than 0.1 arcsec from 1960AD to 2040AD, better than
**     1 arcsec from 1640AD to 2360AD, and remains below 3 arcsec for
**     the whole of the period 500BC to 3000AD.  The errors exceed
**     10 arcsec outside the range 1200BC to 3900AD, exceed 100 arcsec
**     outside 4200BC to 5600AD and exceed 1000 arcsec outside 6800BC to
**     8200AD.
**
**  3) The three angles are returned in the conventional order, which
**     is not the same as the order of the corresponding Euler
**     rotations.  The precession matrix is
**     R_3(-z) x R_2(+theta) x R_3(-zeta).
