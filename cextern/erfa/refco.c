**  Determine the constants A and B in the atmospheric refraction model
**  dZ = A tan Z + B tan^3 Z.
**
**  Z is the "observed" zenith distance (i.e. affected by refraction)
**  and dZ is what to add to Z to give the "topocentric" (i.e. in vacuo)
**  zenith distance.
**
**  Given:
**    phpa   double    pressure at the observer (hPa = millibar)
**    tc     double    ambient temperature at the observer (deg C)
**    rh     double    relative humidity at the observer (range 0-1)
**    wl     double    wavelength (micrometers)
**
**  Returned:
**    refa   double*   tan Z coefficient (radians)
**    refb   double*   tan^3 Z coefficient (radians)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The model balances speed and accuracy to give good results in
**     applications where performance at low altitudes is not paramount.
**     Performance is maintained across a range of conditions, and
**     applies to both optical/IR and radio.
**
**  2) The model omits the effects of (i) height above sea level (apart
**     from the reduced pressure itself), (ii) latitude (i.e. the
**     flattening of the Earth), (iii) variations in tropospheric lapse
**     rate and (iv) dispersive effects in the radio.
**
**     The model was tested using the following range of conditions:
**
**       lapse rates 0.0055, 0.0065, 0.0075 deg/meter
**       latitudes 0, 25, 50, 75 degrees
**       heights 0, 2500, 5000 meters ASL
**       pressures mean for height -10% to +5% in steps of 5%
**       temperatures -10 deg to +20 deg with respect to 280 deg at SL
**       relative humidity 0, 0.5, 1
**       wavelengths 0.4, 0.6, ... 2 micron, + radio
**       zenith distances 15, 45, 75 degrees
**
**     The accuracy with respect to raytracing through a model
**     atmosphere was as follows:
**
**                            worst         RMS
**
**       optical/IR           62 mas       8 mas
**       radio               319 mas      49 mas
**
**     For this particular set of conditions:
**
**       lapse rate 0.0065 K/meter
**       latitude 50 degrees
**       sea level
**       pressure 1005 mb
**       temperature 280.15 K
**       humidity 80%
**       wavelength 5740 Angstroms
**
**     the results were as follows:

**
**     The values for Saastamoinen's formula (which includes terms
**     up to tan^5) are taken from Hohenkerk and Sinclair (1985).
**
**  3) A wl value in the range 0-100 selects the optical/IR case and is
**     wavelength in micrometers.  Any value outside this range selects
**     the radio case.
**
**  4) Outlandish input parameters are silently limited to
**     mathematically safe values.  Zero pressure is permissible, and
**     causes zeroes to be returned.
**
**  5) The algorithm draws on several sources, as follows:
**
**     a) The formula for the saturation vapour pressure of water as
**        a function of temperature and temperature is taken from
**        Equations (A4.5-A4.7) of Gill (1982).
**
**     b) The formula for the water vapour pressure, given the
**        saturation pressure and the relative humidity, is from
**        Crane (1976), Equation (2.5.5).
**
**     c) The refractivity of air is a function of temperature,
**        total pressure, water-vapour pressure and, in the case
**        of optical/IR, wavelength.  The formulae for the two cases are
**        developed from Hohenkerk & Sinclair (1985) and Rueger (2002).
**
**     d) The formula for beta, the ratio of the scale height of the
**        atmosphere to the geocentric distance of the observer, is
**        an adaption of Equation (9) from Stone (1996).  The
**        adaptations, arrived at empirically, consist of (i) a small
**        adjustment to the coefficient and (ii) a humidity term for the
**        radio case only.
**
**     e) The formulae for the refraction constants as a function of
**        n-1 and beta are from Green (1987), Equation (4.31).
