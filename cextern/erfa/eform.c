**
**  Earth reference ellipsoids.
**
**  Given:
**     n    int         ellipsoid identifier (Note 1)
**
**  Returned:
**     a    double      equatorial radius (meters, Note 2)
**     f    double      flattening (Note 2)
**
**  Returned (function value):
**          int         status:  0 = OK
**                              -1 = illegal identifier (Note 3)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The identifier n is a number that specifies the choice of
**     reference ellipsoid.  The following are supported:
**
**        n    ellipsoid
**
**        1     ERFA_WGS84
**        2     ERFA_GRS80
**        3     ERFA_WGS72
**
**     The n value has no significance outside the ERFA software.  For
**     convenience, symbols ERFA_WGS84 etc. are defined in erfam.h.
**
**  2) The ellipsoid parameters are returned in the form of equatorial
**     radius in meters (a) and flattening (f).  The latter is a number
**     around 0.00335, i.e. around 1/298.
**
**  3) For the case where an unsupported n value is supplied, zero a and
**     f are returned, as well as error status.
