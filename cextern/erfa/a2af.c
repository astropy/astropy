**
**  Decompose radians into degrees, arcminutes, arcseconds, fraction.
**
**  Given:
**     ndp     int     resolution (Note 1)
**     angle   double  angle in radians
**
**  Returned:
**     sign    char    '+' or '-'
**     idmsf   int[4]  degrees, arcminutes, arcseconds, fraction
**
**  Called:
**     eraD2tf      decompose days to hms
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The argument ndp is interpreted as follows:
**
**     ndp         resolution
**      :      ...0000 00 00
**     -7         1000 00 00
**     -6          100 00 00
**     -5           10 00 00
**     -4            1 00 00
**     -3            0 10 00
**     -2            0 01 00
**     -1            0 00 10
**      0            0 00 01
**      1            0 00 00.1
**      2            0 00 00.01
**      3            0 00 00.001
**      :            0 00 00.000...
**
**  2) The largest positive useful value for ndp is determined by the
**     size of angle, the format of doubles on the target platform, and
**     the risk of overflowing idmsf[3].  On a typical platform, for
**     angle up to 2pi, the available floating-point precision might
**     correspond to ndp=12.  However, the practical limit is typically
**     ndp=9, set by the capacity of a 32-bit int, or ndp=4 if int is
**     only 16 bits.
**
**  3) The absolute value of angle may exceed 2pi.  In cases where it
**     does not, it is up to the caller to test for and handle the
**     case where angle is very nearly 2pi and rounds up to 360 degrees,
**     by testing for idmsf[0]=360 and setting idmsf[0-3] to zero.
