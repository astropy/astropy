**
**  Earth rotation angle (IAU 2000 model).
**
**  Given:
**     dj1,dj2   double    UT1 as a 2-part Julian Date (see note)
**
**  Returned (function value):
**               double    Earth rotation angle (radians), range 0-2pi
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The UT1 date dj1+dj2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the arguments dj1 and dj2.  For example,
**     JD(UT1)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
**     among others:
**
**             dj1            dj2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 and MJD methods are good compromises
**     between resolution and convenience.  The date & time method is
**     best matched to the algorithm used:  maximum precision is
**     delivered when the dj1 argument is for 0hrs UT1 on the day in
**     question and the dj2 argument lies in the range 0 to 1, or vice
**     versa.
**
**  2) The algorithm is adapted from Expression 22 of Capitaine et al.
**     2000.  The time argument has been expressed in days directly,
**     and, to retain precision, integer contributions have been
**     eliminated.  The same formulation is given in IERS Conventions
**     (2003), Chap. 5, Eq. 14.

**     eraAnp       normalize angle into range 0 to 2pi
