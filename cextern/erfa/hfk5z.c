**
**  Transform a Hipparcos star position into FK5 J2000.0, assuming
**  zero Hipparcos proper motion.
**
**  Given:
**     rh            double    Hipparcos RA (radians)
**     dh            double    Hipparcos Dec (radians)
**     date1,date2   double    TDB date (Note 1)
**
**  Returned (all FK5, equinox J2000.0, date date1+date2):
**     r5            double    RA (radians)
**     d5            double    Dec (radians)
**     dr5           double    FK5 RA proper motion (rad/year, Note 4)
**     dd5           double    Dec proper motion (rad/year, Note 4)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
**     among others:
**
**            date1          date2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  2) The proper motion in RA is dRA/dt rather than cos(Dec)*dRA/dt.
**
**  3) The FK5 to Hipparcos transformation is modeled as a pure rotation
**     and spin;  zonal errors in the FK5 catalogue are not taken into
**     account.
**
**  4) It was the intention that Hipparcos should be a close
**     approximation to an inertial frame, so that distant objects have
**     zero proper motion;  such objects have (in general) non-zero
**     proper motion in FK5, and this function returns those fictitious
**     proper motions.
**
**  5) The position returned by this function is in the FK5 J2000.0
**     reference system but at date date1+date2.
**
**  6) See also eraFk52h, eraH2fk5, eraFk5zhz.

**     eraS2c       spherical coordinates to unit vector
