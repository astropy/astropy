**
**  Deflection of starlight by the Sun.
**
**  Given:
**     p      double[3]  direction from observer to star (unit vector)
**     e      double[3]  direction from Sun to observer (unit vector)
**     em     double     distance from Sun to observer (au)
**
**  Returned:
**     p1     double[3]  observer to deflected star (unit vector)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The source is presumed to be sufficiently distant that its
**     directions seen from the Sun and the observer are essentially
**     the same.
**
**  2) The deflection is restrained when the angle between the star and
**     the center of the Sun is less than about 9 arcsec, falling to
**     zero for zero separation. (The chosen threshold is within the
**     solar limb for all solar-system applications.)
**
**  3) The arguments p and p1 can be the same array.
**
**  Called:
**     eraLd        light deflection by a solar-system body

**  The ERFA version is intended to retain identical functionality to

**  concept of "read only" software.
**  
**  Although the intent is to replicate the SOFA API (other than
**  replacement of prefix names) and results (with the exception of
**  bugs;  any that are discovered will be fixed), SOFA is not
