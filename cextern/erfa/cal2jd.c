**
**  Gregorian Calendar to Julian Date.
**
**  Given:
**     iy,im,id  int     year, month, day in Gregorian calendar (Note 1)
**
**  Returned:
**     djm0      double  MJD zero-point: always 2400000.5
**     djm       double  Modified Julian Date for 0 hrs
**
**  Returned (function value):
**               int     status:
**                           0 = OK
**                          -1 = bad year   (Note 3: JD not computed)
**                          -2 = bad month  (JD not computed)
**                          -3 = bad day    (JD computed)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The algorithm used is valid from -4800 March 1, but this
**     implementation rejects dates before -4799 January 1.
**
**  2) The Julian Date is returned in two pieces, in the usual ERFA
**     manner, which is designed to preserve time resolution.  The
**     Julian Date is available as a single number by adding djm0 and
**     djm.
**
**  3) In early eras the conversion is from the "Proleptic Gregorian
**     Calendar";  no account is taken of the date(s) of adoption of
**     the Gregorian Calendar, nor is the AD/BC numbering convention
**     observed.
