**
**  Format for output a 2-part Julian Date (or in the case of UTC a
**  quasi-JD form that includes special provision for leap seconds).
**
**  Given:
**     scale     char[]  time scale ID (Note 1)
**     ndp       int     resolution (Note 2)
**     d1,d2     double  time as a 2-part Julian Date (Notes 3,4)
**
**  Returned:
**     iy,im,id  int     year, month, day in Gregorian calendar (Note 5)
**     ihmsf     int[4]  hours, minutes, seconds, fraction (Note 1)
**
**  Returned (function value):
**               int     status: +1 = dubious year (Note 5)
**                                0 = OK
**                               -1 = unacceptable date (Note 6)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) scale identifies the time scale.  Only the value "UTC" (in upper
**     case) is significant, and enables handling of leap seconds (see
**     Note 4).
**
**  2) ndp is the number of decimal places in the seconds field, and can
**     have negative as well as positive values, such as:
**
**     ndp         resolution
**     -4            1 00 00
**     -3            0 10 00
**     -2            0 01 00
**     -1            0 00 10
**      0            0 00 01
**      1            0 00 00.1
**      2            0 00 00.01
**      3            0 00 00.001
**
**     The limits are platform dependent, but a safe range is -5 to +9.
**
**  3) d1+d2 is Julian Date, apportioned in any convenient way between
**     the two arguments, for example where d1 is the Julian Day Number
**     and d2 is the fraction of a day.  In the case of UTC, where the
**     use of JD is problematical, special conventions apply:  see the
**     next note.
**
**  4) JD cannot unambiguously represent UTC during a leap second unless
**     special measures are taken.  The ERFA internal convention is that
**     the quasi-JD day represents UTC days whether the length is 86399,
**     86400 or 86401 SI seconds.  In the 1960-1972 era there were
**     smaller jumps (in either direction) each time the linear UTC(TAI)
**     expression was changed, and these "mini-leaps" are also included
**     in the ERFA convention.
**
**  5) The warning status "dubious year" flags UTCs that predate the
**     introduction of the time scale or that are too far in the future
**     to be trusted.  See eraDat for further details.
**
**  6) For calendar conventions and limitations, see eraCal2jd.
