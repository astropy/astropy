**  CIRS RA,Dec to observed place.  The caller supplies UTC, site
**  coordinates, ambient air conditions and observing wavelength.
**
**  Given:
**     ri     double   CIRS right ascension (CIO-based, radians)
**     di     double   CIRS declination (radians)
**     utc1   double   UTC as a 2-part...
**     utc2   double   ...quasi Julian Date (Notes 1,2)
**     dut1   double   UT1-UTC (seconds, Note 3)
**     elong  double   longitude (radians, east +ve, Note 4)
**     phi    double   geodetic latitude (radians, Note 4)
**     hm     double   height above ellipsoid (m, geodetic Notes 4,6)
**     xp,yp  double   polar motion coordinates (radians, Note 5)
**     phpa   double   pressure at the observer (hPa = mB, Note 6)
**     tc     double   ambient temperature at the observer (deg C)
**     rh     double   relative humidity at the observer (range 0-1)
**     wl     double   wavelength (micrometers, Note 7)
**
**  Returned:
**     aob    double*  observed azimuth (radians: N=0,E=90)
**     zob    double*  observed zenith distance (radians)
**     hob    double*  observed hour angle (radians)
**     dob    double*  observed declination (radians)
**     rob    double*  observed right ascension (CIO-based, radians)
**
**  Returned (function value):
**            int      status: +1 = dubious year (Note 2)
**                              0 = OK
**                             -1 = unacceptable date
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1)  utc1+utc2 is quasi Julian Date (see Note 2), apportioned in any
**      convenient way between the two arguments, for example where utc1
**      is the Julian Day Number and utc2 is the fraction of a day.
**
**      However, JD cannot unambiguously represent UTC during a leap
**      second unless special measures are taken.  The convention in the
**      present function is that the JD day represents UTC days whether
**      the length is 86399, 86400 or 86401 SI seconds.
**
**      Applications should use the function eraDtf2d to convert from
**      calendar date and time of day into 2-part quasi Julian Date, as
**      it implements the leap-second-ambiguity convention just
**      described.
**
**  2)  The warning status "dubious year" flags UTCs that predate the
**      introduction of the time scale or that are too far in the
**      future to be trusted.  See eraDat for further details.
**
**  3)  UT1-UTC is tabulated in IERS bulletins.  It increases by exactly
**      one second at the end of each positive UTC leap second,
**      introduced in order to keep UT1-UTC within +/- 0.9s.  n.b. This
**      practice is under review, and in the future UT1-UTC may grow
**      essentially without limit.
**
**  4)  The geographical coordinates are with respect to the ERFA_WGS84
**      reference ellipsoid.  TAKE CARE WITH THE LONGITUDE SIGN:  the
**      longitude required by the present function is east-positive
**      (i.e. right-handed), in accordance with geographical convention.
**
**  5)  The polar motion xp,yp can be obtained from IERS bulletins.  The
**      values are the coordinates (in radians) of the Celestial
**      Intermediate Pole with respect to the International Terrestrial
**      Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003), measured along the
**      meridians 0 and 90 deg west respectively.  For many
**      applications, xp and yp can be set to zero.
**
**  6)  If hm, the height above the ellipsoid of the observing station
**      in meters, is not known but phpa, the pressure in hPa (=mB), is
**      available, an adequate estimate of hm can be obtained from the
**      expression
**
**            hm = -29.3 * tsl * log ( phpa / 1013.25 );
**
**      where tsl is the approximate sea-level air temperature in K
**      (See Astrophysical Quantities, C.W.Allen, 3rd edition, section
**      52).  Similarly, if the pressure phpa is not known, it can be
**      estimated from the height of the observing station, hm, as
**      follows:
**
**            phpa = 1013.25 * exp ( -hm / ( 29.3 * tsl ) );
**
**      Note, however, that the refraction is nearly proportional to
**      the pressure and that an accurate phpa value is important for
**      precise work.
**
**  7)  The argument wl specifies the observing wavelength in
**      micrometers.  The transition from optical to radio is assumed to
**      occur at 100 micrometers (about 3000 GHz).
**
**  8)  "Observed" Az,ZD means the position that would be seen by a
**      perfect geodetically aligned theodolite.  (Zenith distance is
**      used rather than altitude in order to reflect the fact that no
**      allowance is made for depression of the horizon.)  This is
**      related to the observed HA,Dec via the standard rotation, using
**      the geodetic latitude (corrected for polar motion), while the
**      observed HA and RA are related simply through the Earth rotation
**      angle and the site longitude.  "Observed" RA,Dec or HA,Dec thus
**      means the position that would be seen by a perfect equatorial
**      with its polar axis aligned to the Earth's axis of rotation.
**
**  9)  The accuracy of the result is limited by the corrections for
**      refraction, which use a simple A*tan(z) + B*tan^3(z) model.
**      Providing the meteorological parameters are known accurately and
**      there are no gross local effects, the predicted astrometric
**      coordinates should be within 0.05 arcsec (optical) or 1 arcsec
**      (radio) for a zenith distance of less than 70 degrees, better
**      than 30 arcsec (optical or radio) at 85 degrees and better
**      than 20 arcmin (optical) or 30 arcmin (radio) at the horizon.
**
**  10) The complementary functions eraAtio13 and eraAtoi13 are self-
**      consistent to better than 1 microarcsecond all over the
**      celestial sphere.
**
**  11) It is advisable to take great care with units, as even unlikely
**      values of the input parameters are accepted and processed in
**      accordance with the models used.
