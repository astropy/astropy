**
**  Greenwich mean sidereal time (consistent with IAU 2006 precession).
**
**  Given:
**     uta,utb    double    UT1 as a 2-part Julian Date (Notes 1,2)
**     tta,ttb    double    TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Notes 1,2)
**
**  Returned (function value):
**                double    Greenwich mean sidereal time (radians)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The UT1 and TT dates uta+utb and tta+ttb respectively, are both
**     Julian Dates, apportioned in any convenient way between the
**     argument pairs.  For example, JD=2450123.7 could be expressed in
**     any of these ways, among others:
**
**            Part A        Part B
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable (in the case of UT;  the TT is not at all critical
**     in this respect).  The J2000 and MJD methods are good compromises
**     between resolution and convenience.  For UT, the date & time
**     method is best matched to the algorithm that is used by the Earth
**     rotation angle function, called internally:  maximum precision is
**     delivered when the uta argument is for 0hrs UT1 on the day in
**     question and the utb argument lies in the range 0 to 1, or vice
**     versa.
**
**  2) Both UT1 and TT are required, UT1 to predict the Earth rotation
**     and TT to predict the effects of precession.  If UT1 is used for
**     both purposes, errors of order 100 microarcseconds result.
**
**  3) This GMST is compatible with the IAU 2006 precession and must not
**     be used with other precession models.
**
**  4) The result is returned in the range 0 to 2pi.
**
**  Called:
**     eraEra00     Earth rotation angle, IAU 2000
**     eraAnp       normalize angle into range 0 to 2pi
