**  The ERFA version is intended to retain identical functionality to

**  concept of "read only" software.
**  
**  Although the intent is to replicate the SOFA API (other than
**  replacement of prefix names) and results (with the exception of
**  bugs;  any that are discovered will be fixed), SOFA is not
**  responsible for any errors found in this version of the library.
