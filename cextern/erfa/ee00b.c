**
**  Equation of the equinoxes, compatible with IAU 2000 resolutions but
**  using the truncated nutation model IAU 2000B.
**
**  Given:
**     date1,date2  double    TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
**
**  Returned (function value):
**                  double    equation of the equinoxes (Note 2)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
**     among others:
**
**            date1          date2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  2) The result, which is in radians, operates in the following sense:
**
**        Greenwich apparent ST = GMST + equation of the equinoxes
**
**  3) The result is compatible with the IAU 2000 resolutions except
**     that accuracy has been compromised for the sake of speed.  For
**     further details, see McCarthy & Luzum (2001), IERS Conventions
**     2003 and Capitaine et al. (2003).
