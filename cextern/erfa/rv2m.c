**  Form the r-matrix corresponding to a given r-vector.
**
**  Given:
**     w        double[3]      rotation vector (Note 1)
**
**  Returned:
**     r        double[3][3]    rotation matrix
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) A rotation matrix describes a rotation through some angle about
**     some arbitrary axis called the Euler axis.  The "rotation vector"
**     supplied to This function has the same direction as the Euler
**     axis, and its magnitude is the angle in radians.
**
**  2) If w is null, the unit matrix is returned.
**
**  3) The reference frame rotates clockwise as seen looking along the
**     rotation vector from the origin.
