**  Time scale transformation:  Terrestrial Time, TT, to Universal Time,
**  UT1.
**
**  Given:
**     tt1,tt2    double    TT as a 2-part Julian Date
**     dt         double    TT-UT1 in seconds
**
**  Returned:
**     ut11,ut12  double    UT1 as a 2-part Julian Date
**
**  Returned (function value):
**                int       status:  0 = OK
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) tt1+tt2 is Julian Date, apportioned in any convenient way between
**     the two arguments, for example where tt1 is the Julian Day Number
**     and tt2 is the fraction of a day.  The returned ut11,ut12 follow
**     suit.
**
**  2) The argument dt is classical Delta T.
