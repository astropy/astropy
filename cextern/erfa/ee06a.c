**
**  Equation of the equinoxes, compatible with IAU 2000 resolutions and
**  IAU 2006/2000A precession-nutation.
**
**  Given:
**     date1,date2  double    TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
**
**  Returned (function value):
**                  double    equation of the equinoxes (Note 2)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
**     among others:
**
**            date1          date2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  2) The result, which is in radians, operates in the following sense:
**
**        Greenwich apparent ST = GMST + equation of the equinoxes
**
**  Called:
**     eraAnpm      normalize angle into range +/- pi
**     eraGst06a    Greenwich apparent sidereal time, IAU 2006/2000A
**     eraGmst06    Greenwich mean sidereal time, IAU 2006
