**
**  Form the celestial to terrestrial matrix given the date, the UT1 and
**  the polar motion, using the IAU 2000B nutation model.
**
**  Given:
**     tta,ttb  double         TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
**     uta,utb  double         UT1 as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
**     xp,yp    double         coordinates of the pole (radians, Note 2)
**
**  Returned:
**     rc2t     double[3][3]   celestial-to-terrestrial matrix (Note 3)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The TT and UT1 dates tta+ttb and uta+utb are Julian Dates,
**     apportioned in any convenient way between the arguments uta and
**     utb.  For example, JD(UT1)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of
**     these ways, among others:
**
**             uta            utb
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
**     acceptable.  The J2000 and MJD methods are good compromises
**     between resolution and convenience.  In the case of uta,utb, the
**     date & time method is best matched to the Earth rotation angle
**     algorithm used:  maximum precision is delivered when the uta
**     argument is for 0hrs UT1 on the day in question and the utb
**     argument lies in the range 0 to 1, or vice versa.
**
**  2) The arguments xp and yp are the coordinates (in radians) of the
**     Celestial Intermediate Pole with respect to the International
**     Terrestrial Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003),
**     measured along the meridians to 0 and 90 deg west respectively.
**
**  3) The matrix rc2t transforms from celestial to terrestrial
**     coordinates:
**
**        [TRS] = RPOM * R_3(ERA) * RC2I * [CRS]
**
**              = rc2t * [CRS]
**
**     where [CRS] is a vector in the Geocentric Celestial Reference
**     System and [TRS] is a vector in the International Terrestrial
**     Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003), RC2I is the
**     celestial-to-intermediate matrix, ERA is the Earth rotation
**     angle and RPOM is the polar motion matrix.
**
**  4) The present function is faster, but slightly less accurate (about
**     1 mas), than the eraC2t00a function.
**
**  Called:
**     eraC2i00b    celestial-to-intermediate matrix, IAU 2000B
**     eraEra00     Earth rotation angle, IAU 2000
**     eraPom00     polar motion matrix
**     eraC2tcio    form CIO-based celestial-to-terrestrial matrix
