**
**  Frame bias and precession, IAU 2000.
**
**  Given:
**     date1,date2  double         TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
**
**  Returned:
**     rb           double[3][3]   frame bias matrix (Note 2)
**     rp           double[3][3]   precession matrix (Note 3)
**     rbp          double[3][3]   bias-precession matrix (Note 4)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
**     among others:
**
**             date1         date2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  2) The matrix rb transforms vectors from GCRS to mean J2000.0 by
**     applying frame bias.
**
**  3) The matrix rp transforms vectors from J2000.0 mean equator and
**     equinox to mean equator and equinox of date by applying
**     precession.
**
**  4) The matrix rbp transforms vectors from GCRS to mean equator and
**     equinox of date by applying frame bias then precession.  It is
**     the product rp x rb.
**
**  5) It is permissible to re-use the same array in the returned
**     arguments.  The arrays are filled in the order given.
**
**  Called:
**     eraBi00      frame bias components, IAU 2000
**     eraPr00      IAU 2000 precession adjustments
**     eraIr        initialize r-matrix to identity
**     eraRx        rotate around X-axis
**     eraRy        rotate around Y-axis
**     eraRz        rotate around Z-axis
**     eraCr        copy r-matrix
**     eraRxr       product of two r-matrices
