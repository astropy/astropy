**
**  Convert position/velocity from Cartesian to spherical coordinates.
**
**  Given:
**     pv       double[2][3]  pv-vector
**
**  Returned:
**     theta    double        longitude angle (radians)
**     phi      double        latitude angle (radians)
**     r        double        radial distance
**     td       double        rate of change of theta
**     pd       double        rate of change of phi
**     rd       double        rate of change of r
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) If the position part of pv is null, theta, phi, td and pd
**     are indeterminate.  This is handled by extrapolating the
**     position through unit time by using the velocity part of
**     pv.  This moves the origin without changing the direction
**     of the velocity component.  If the position and velocity
**     components of pv are both null, zeroes are returned for all
**     six results.
**
**  2) If the position is a pole, theta, td and pd are indeterminate.
**     In such cases zeroes are returned for all three.
