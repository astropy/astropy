**  Form the celestial to intermediate-frame-of-date matrix given the CIP
**  X,Y and the CIO locator s.
**
**  Given:
**     x,y      double         Celestial Intermediate Pole (Note 1)
**     s        double         the CIO locator s (Note 2)
**
**  Returned:
**     rc2i     double[3][3]   celestial-to-intermediate matrix (Note 3)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The Celestial Intermediate Pole coordinates are the x,y
**     components of the unit vector in the Geocentric Celestial
**     Reference System.
**
**  2) The CIO locator s (in radians) positions the Celestial
**     Intermediate Origin on the equator of the CIP.
**
**  3) The matrix rc2i is the first stage in the transformation from
**     celestial to terrestrial coordinates:
**
**        [TRS] = RPOM * R_3(ERA) * rc2i * [CRS]
**
**              = RC2T * [CRS]
**
**     where [CRS] is a vector in the Geocentric Celestial Reference
**     System and [TRS] is a vector in the International Terrestrial
**     Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003), ERA is the Earth
**     Rotation Angle and RPOM is the polar motion matrix.
**
**  Called:
**     eraIr        initialize r-matrix to identity
**     eraRz        rotate around Z-axis
**     eraRy        rotate around Y-axis
