**
**  Apply light deflection by a solar-system body, as part of
**  transforming coordinate direction into natural direction.
**
**  Given:
**     bm     double     mass of the gravitating body (solar masses)
**     p      double[3]  direction from observer to source (unit vector)
**     q      double[3]  direction from body to source (unit vector)
**     e      double[3]  direction from body to observer (unit vector)
**     em     double     distance from body to observer (au)
**     dlim   double     deflection limiter (Note 4)
**
**  Returned:
**     p1     double[3]  observer to deflected source (unit vector)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The algorithm is based on Expr. (70) in Klioner (2003) and
**     Expr. (7.63) in the Explanatory Supplement (Urban & Seidelmann
**     2013), with some rearrangement to minimize the effects of machine
**     precision.
**
**  2) The mass parameter bm can, as required, be adjusted in order to
**     allow for such effects as quadrupole field.
**
**  3) The barycentric position of the deflecting body should ideally
**     correspond to the time of closest approach of the light ray to
**     the body.
**
**  4) The deflection limiter parameter dlim is phi^2/2, where phi is
**     the angular separation (in radians) between source and body at
**     which limiting is applied.  As phi shrinks below the chosen
**     threshold, the deflection is artificially reduced, reaching zero
**     for phi = 0.
**
**  5) The returned vector p1 is not normalized, but the consequential
**     departure from unit magnitude is always negligible.
**
**  6) The arguments p and p1 can be the same array.
**
**  7) To accumulate total light deflection taking into account the
**     contributions from several bodies, call the present function for
**     each body in succession, in decreasing order of distance from the
**     observer.
**
**  8) For efficiency, validation is omitted.  The supplied vectors must
**     be of unit magnitude, and the deflection limiter non-zero and
**     positive.
