**  Given:
**     iy     int      UTC:  year (Notes 1 and 2)
**     im     int            month (Note 2)
**     id     int            day (Notes 2 and 3)
**     fd     double         fraction of day (Note 4)
**
**  Returned:
**     deltat double   TAI minus UTC, seconds
**
**  Returned (function value):
**            int      status (Note 5):
**                       1 = dubious year (Note 1)
**                       0 = OK
**                      -1 = bad year
**                      -2 = bad month
**                      -3 = bad day (Note 3)
**                      -4 = bad fraction (Note 4)
**                      -5 = internal error (Note 5)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) UTC began at 1960 January 1.0 (JD 2436934.5) and it is improper
**     to call the function with an earlier date.  If this is attempted,
**     zero is returned together with a warning status.
**
**     Because leap seconds cannot, in principle, be predicted in
**     advance, a reliable check for dates beyond the valid range is
**     impossible.  To guard against gross errors, a year five or more
**     after the release year of the present function (see the constant
**     IYV) is considered dubious.  In this case a warning status is
**     returned but the result is computed in the normal way.
**
**     For both too-early and too-late years, the warning status is +1.
**     This is distinct from the error status -1, which signifies a year
**     so early that JD could not be computed.
**
**  2) If the specified date is for a day which ends with a leap second,
**     the UTC-TAI value returned is for the period leading up to the
**     leap second.  If the date is for a day which begins as a leap
**     second ends, the UTC-TAI returned is for the period following the
**     leap second.
**
**  3) The day number must be in the normal calendar range, for example
**     1 through 30 for April.  The "almanac" convention of allowing
**     such dates as January 0 and December 32 is not supported in this
**     function, in order to avoid confusion near leap seconds.
**
**  4) The fraction of day is used only for dates before the
**     introduction of leap seconds, the first of which occurred at the
**     end of 1971.  It is tested for validity (0 to 1 is the valid
**     range) even if not used;  if invalid, zero is used and status -4
**     is returned.  For many applications, setting fd to zero is
**     acceptable;  the resulting error is always less than 3 ms (and
**     occurs only pre-1972).
**
**  5) The status value returned in the case where there are multiple
**     errors refers to the first error detected.  For example, if the
**     month and day are 13 and 32 respectively, status -2 (bad month)
**     will be returned.  The "internal error" status refers to a
**     case that is impossible but causes some compilers to issue a
**     warning.
**
**  6) In cases where a valid result is not available, zero is returned.
