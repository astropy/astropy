**  Fundamental argument, IERS Conventions (2003):
**  mean longitude of Uranus.
**
**  Given:
**     t     double    TDB, Julian centuries since J2000.0 (Note 1)
**
**  Returned  (function value):
**           double    mean longitude of Uranus, radians (Note 2)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) Though t is strictly TDB, it is usually more convenient to use
**     TT, which makes no significant difference.
**
**  2) The expression used is as adopted in IERS Conventions (2003) and
**     is adapted from Simon et al. (1994).
