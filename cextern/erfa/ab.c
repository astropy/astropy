**  Apply aberration to transform natural direction into proper
**  direction.
**
**  Given:
**    pnat    double[3]   natural direction to the source (unit vector)
**    v       double[3]   observer barycentric velocity in units of c
**    s       double      distance between the Sun and the observer (au)
**    bm1     double      sqrt(1-|v|^2): reciprocal of Lorenz factor
**
**  Returned:
**    ppr     double[3]   proper direction to source (unit vector)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The algorithm is based on Expr. (7.40) in the Explanatory
**     Supplement (Urban & Seidelmann 2013), but with the following
**     changes:
**
**     o  Rigorous rather than approximate normalization is applied.
**
**     o  The gravitational potential term from Expr. (7) in
**        Klioner (2003) is added, taking into account only the Sun's
**        contribution.  This has a maximum effect of about
**        0.4 microarcsecond.
**
**  2) In almost all cases, the maximum accuracy will be limited by the
**     supplied velocity.  For example, if the ERFA eraEpv00 function is
**     used, errors of up to 5 microarcseconds could occur.
