**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) This function exists to enable sidereal-tracking applications to
**     avoid wasteful recomputation of the bulk of the astrometry
**     parameters:  only the Earth rotation is updated.
**
**  2) For targets expressed as equinox based positions, such as
**     classical geocentric apparent (RA,Dec), the supplied theta can be
**     Greenwich apparent sidereal time rather than Earth rotation
**     angle.
**
**  3) The function eraAper13 can be used instead of the present
**     function, and starts from UT1 rather than ERA itself.
**
**  4) This is one of several functions that inserts into the astrom
**     structure star-independent parameters needed for the chain of
**     astrometric transformations ICRS <-> GCRS <-> CIRS <-> observed.
**
**     The various functions support different classes of observer and
**     portions of the transformation chain:
**
**          functions         observer        transformation
**
**       eraApcg eraApcg13    geocentric      ICRS <-> GCRS
**       eraApci eraApci13    terrestrial     ICRS <-> CIRS
**       eraApco eraApco13    terrestrial     ICRS <-> observed
**       eraApcs eraApcs13    space           ICRS <-> GCRS
**       eraAper eraAper13    terrestrial     update Earth rotation
**       eraApio eraApio13    terrestrial     CIRS <-> observed
**
**     Those with names ending in "13" use contemporary ERFA models to
**     compute the various ephemerides.  The others accept ephemerides
**     supplied by the caller.
**
**     The transformation from ICRS to GCRS covers space motion,
**     parallax, light deflection, and aberration.  From GCRS to CIRS
**     comprises frame bias and precession-nutation.  From CIRS to
**     observed takes account of Earth rotation, polar motion, diurnal
**     aberration and parallax (unless subsumed into the ICRS <-> GCRS
**     transformation), and atmospheric refraction.
