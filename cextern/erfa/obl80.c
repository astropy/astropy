**
**  Mean obliquity of the ecliptic, IAU 1980 model.
**
**  Given:
**     date1,date2   double    TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
**
**  Returned (function value):
**                   double    obliquity of the ecliptic (radians, Note 2)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
**     among others:
**
**            date1          date2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  2) The result is the angle between the ecliptic and mean equator of
**     date date1+date2.
