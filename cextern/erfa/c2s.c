**  P-vector to spherical coordinates.
**
**  Given:
**     p      double[3]    p-vector
**
**  Returned:
**     theta  double       longitude angle (radians)
**     phi    double       latitude angle (radians)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The vector p can have any magnitude; only its direction is used.
**
**  2) If p is null, zero theta and phi are returned.
**
**  3) At either pole, zero theta is returned.

**  Although the intent is to replicate the SOFA API (other than
**  replacement of prefix names) and results (with the exception of
**  bugs;  any that are discovered will be fixed), SOFA is not
