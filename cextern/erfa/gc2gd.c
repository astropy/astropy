**
**  Transform geocentric coordinates to geodetic using the specified
**  reference ellipsoid.
**
**  Given:
**     n       int        ellipsoid identifier (Note 1)
**     xyz     double[3]  geocentric vector (Note 2)
**
**  Returned:
**     elong   double     longitude (radians, east +ve, Note 3)
**     phi     double     latitude (geodetic, radians, Note 3)
**     height  double     height above ellipsoid (geodetic, Notes 2,3)
**
**  Returned (function value):
**            int         status:  0 = OK
**                                -1 = illegal identifier (Note 3)
**                                -2 = internal error (Note 3)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The identifier n is a number that specifies the choice of
**     reference ellipsoid.  The following are supported:
**
**        n    ellipsoid
**
**        1     ERFA_WGS84
**        2     ERFA_GRS80
**        3     ERFA_WGS72
**
**     The n value has no significance outside the ERFA software.  For
**     convenience, symbols ERFA_WGS84 etc. are defined in erfam.h.
**
**  2) The geocentric vector (xyz, given) and height (height, returned)
**     are in meters.
**
**  3) An error status -1 means that the identifier n is illegal.  An
**     error status -2 is theoretically impossible.  In all error cases,
**     all three results are set to -1e9.
**
**  4) The inverse transformation is performed in the function eraGd2gc.
