**  Inner (=scalar=dot) product of two pv-vectors.
**
**  Given:
**     a        double[2][3]      first pv-vector
**     b        double[2][3]      second pv-vector
**
**  Returned:
**     adb      double[2]         a . b (see note)
**
**  Note:
**
**     If the position and velocity components of the two pv-vectors are
**     ( ap, av ) and ( bp, bv ), the result, a . b, is the pair of
**     numbers ( ap . bp , ap . bv + av . bp ).  The two numbers are the
**     dot-product of the two p-vectors and its derivative.
**
**  Called:
**     eraPdp       scalar product of two p-vectors
