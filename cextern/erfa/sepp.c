**
**  Angular separation between two p-vectors.
**
**  Given:
**     a      double[3]    first p-vector (not necessarily unit length)
**     b      double[3]    second p-vector (not necessarily unit length)
**
**  Returned (function value):
**            double       angular separation (radians, always positive)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) If either vector is null, a zero result is returned.
**
**  2) The angular separation is most simply formulated in terms of
**     scalar product.  However, this gives poor accuracy for angles
**     near zero and pi.  The present algorithm uses both cross product
**     and dot product, to deliver full accuracy whatever the size of
**     the angle.
**
**  Called:
**     eraPxp       vector product of two p-vectors
**     eraPm        modulus of p-vector
**     eraPdp       scalar product of two p-vectors
