**
**  Quick ICRS to CIRS transformation, given precomputed star-
**  independent astrometry parameters, and assuming zero parallax and
**  proper motion.
**
**  Use of this function is appropriate when efficiency is important and
**  where many star positions are to be transformed for one date.  The
**  star-independent parameters can be obtained by calling one of the
**  functions eraApci[13], eraApcg[13], eraApco[13] or eraApcs[13].
**
**  The corresponding function for the case of non-zero parallax and
**  proper motion is eraAtciq.
**
**  Given:
**     rc,dc  double     ICRS astrometric RA,Dec (radians)
**     astrom eraASTROM* star-independent astrometry parameters:
**      pmt    double       PM time interval (SSB, Julian years)
**      eb     double[3]    SSB to observer (vector, au)
**      eh     double[3]    Sun to observer (unit vector)
**      em     double       distance from Sun to observer (au)
**      v      double[3]    barycentric observer velocity (vector, c)
**      bm1    double       sqrt(1-|v|^2): reciprocal of Lorenz factor
**      bpn    double[3][3] bias-precession-nutation matrix
**      along  double       longitude + s' (radians)
**      xpl    double       polar motion xp wrt local meridian (radians)
**      ypl    double       polar motion yp wrt local meridian (radians)
**      sphi   double       sine of geodetic latitude
**      cphi   double       cosine of geodetic latitude
**      diurab double       magnitude of diurnal aberration vector
**      eral   double       "local" Earth rotation angle (radians)
**      refa   double       refraction constant A (radians)
**      refb   double       refraction constant B (radians)
**
**  Returned:
**     ri,di  double     CIRS RA,Dec (radians)
**
**  Note:
**
**     All the vectors are with respect to BCRS axes.
