**  Form rotation matrix given the Fukushima-Williams angles.
**
**  Given:
**     gamb     double         F-W angle gamma_bar (radians)
**     phib     double         F-W angle phi_bar (radians)
**     psi      double         F-W angle psi (radians)
**     eps      double         F-W angle epsilon (radians)
**
**  Returned:
**     r        double[3][3]   rotation matrix
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) Naming the following points:
**
**           e = J2000.0 ecliptic pole,
**           p = GCRS pole,
**           E = ecliptic pole of date,
**     and   P = CIP,
**
**     the four Fukushima-Williams angles are as follows:
**
**        gamb = gamma = epE
**        phib = phi = pE
**        psi = psi = pEP
**        eps = epsilon = EP
**
**  2) The matrix representing the combined effects of frame bias,
**     precession and nutation is:
**
**        NxPxB = R_1(-eps).R_3(-psi).R_1(phib).R_3(gamb)
**
**  3) Three different matrices can be constructed, depending on the
**     supplied angles:
**
**     o  To obtain the nutation x precession x frame bias matrix,
**        generate the four precession angles, generate the nutation
**        components and add them to the psi_bar and epsilon_A angles,
**        and call the present function.
**
**     o  To obtain the precession x frame bias matrix, generate the
**        four precession angles and call the present function.
**
**     o  To obtain the frame bias matrix, generate the four precession
**        angles for date J2000.0 and call the present function.
**
**     The nutation-only and precession-only matrices can if necessary
**     be obtained by combining these three appropriately.
**
**  Called:
**     eraIr        initialize r-matrix to identity
**     eraRz        rotate around Z-axis
**     eraRx        rotate around X-axis
