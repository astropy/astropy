**  Proper motion and parallax.
**
**  Given:
**     rc,dc  double     ICRS RA,Dec at catalog epoch (radians)
**     pr     double     RA proper motion (radians/year; Note 1)
**     pd     double     Dec proper motion (radians/year)
**     px     double     parallax (arcsec)
**     rv     double     radial velocity (km/s, +ve if receding)
**     pmt    double     proper motion time interval (SSB, Julian years)
**     pob    double[3]  SSB to observer vector (au)
**
**  Returned:
**     pco    double[3]  coordinate direction (BCRS unit vector)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The proper motion in RA is dRA/dt rather than cos(Dec)*dRA/dt.
**
**  2) The proper motion time interval is for when the starlight
**     reaches the solar system barycenter.
**
**  3) To avoid the need for iteration, the Roemer effect (i.e. the
**     small annual modulation of the proper motion coming from the
**     changing light time) is applied approximately, using the
**     direction of the star at the catalog epoch.
