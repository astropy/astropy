**
**  IAU 2000A nutation with adjustments to match the IAU 2006
**  precession.
**
**  Given:
**     date1,date2   double   TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
**
**  Returned:
**     dpsi,deps     double   nutation, luni-solar + planetary (Note 2)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
**     among others:
**
**            date1          date2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  2) The nutation components in longitude and obliquity are in radians
**     and with respect to the mean equinox and ecliptic of date,
**     IAU 2006 precession model (Hilton et al. 2006, Capitaine et al.
**     2005).
**
**  3) The function first computes the IAU 2000A nutation, then applies
**     adjustments for (i) the consequences of the change in obliquity
**     from the IAU 1980 ecliptic to the IAU 2006 ecliptic and (ii) the
**     secular variation in the Earth's dynamical form factor J2.
**
**  4) The present function provides classical nutation, complementing
**     the IAU 2000 frame bias and IAU 2006 precession.  It delivers a
**     pole which is at current epochs accurate to a few tens of
**     microarcseconds, apart from the free core nutation.
