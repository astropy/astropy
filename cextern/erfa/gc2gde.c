**
**  Transform geocentric coordinates to geodetic for a reference
**  ellipsoid of specified form.
**
**  Given:
**     a       double     equatorial radius (Notes 2,4)
**     f       double     flattening (Note 3)
**     xyz     double[3]  geocentric vector (Note 4)
**
**  Returned:
**     elong   double     longitude (radians, east +ve)
**     phi     double     latitude (geodetic, radians)
**     height  double     height above ellipsoid (geodetic, Note 4)
**
**  Returned (function value):
**             int        status:  0 = OK
**                                -1 = illegal f
**                                -2 = illegal a
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) This function is based on the GCONV2H Fortran subroutine by
**     Toshio Fukushima (see reference).
**
**  2) The equatorial radius, a, can be in any units, but meters is
**     the conventional choice.
**
**  3) The flattening, f, is (for the Earth) a value around 0.00335,
**     i.e. around 1/298.
**
**  4) The equatorial radius, a, and the geocentric vector, xyz,
**     must be given in the same units, and determine the units of
**     the returned height, height.
**
**  5) If an error occurs (status < 0), elong, phi and height are
**     unchanged.
**
**  6) The inverse transformation is performed in the function
**     eraGd2gce.
**
**  7) The transformation for a standard ellipsoid (such as ERFA_WGS84) can
**     more conveniently be performed by calling eraGc2gd, which uses a
**     numerical code to identify the required A and F values.
