**  Quick CIRS to observed place transformation.
**
**  Use of this function is appropriate when efficiency is important and
**  where many star positions are all to be transformed for one date.
**  The star-independent astrometry parameters can be obtained by
**  calling eraApio[13] or eraApco[13].
**
**  Given:
**     ri     double     CIRS right ascension
**     di     double     CIRS declination
**     astrom eraASTROM* star-independent astrometry parameters:
**      pmt    double       PM time interval (SSB, Julian years)
**      eb     double[3]    SSB to observer (vector, au)
**      eh     double[3]    Sun to observer (unit vector)
**      em     double       distance from Sun to observer (au)
**      v      double[3]    barycentric observer velocity (vector, c)
**      bm1    double       sqrt(1-|v|^2): reciprocal of Lorenz factor
**      bpn    double[3][3] bias-precession-nutation matrix
**      along  double       longitude + s' (radians)
**      xpl    double       polar motion xp wrt local meridian (radians)
**      ypl    double       polar motion yp wrt local meridian (radians)
**      sphi   double       sine of geodetic latitude
**      cphi   double       cosine of geodetic latitude
**      diurab double       magnitude of diurnal aberration vector
**      eral   double       "local" Earth rotation angle (radians)
**      refa   double       refraction constant A (radians)
**      refb   double       refraction constant B (radians)
**
**  Returned:
**     aob    double*    observed azimuth (radians: N=0,E=90)
**     zob    double*    observed zenith distance (radians)
**     hob    double*    observed hour angle (radians)
**     dob    double*    observed declination (radians)
**     rob    double*    observed right ascension (CIO-based, radians)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) This function returns zenith distance rather than altitude in
**     order to reflect the fact that no allowance is made for
**     depression of the horizon.
**
**  2) The accuracy of the result is limited by the corrections for
**     refraction, which use a simple A*tan(z) + B*tan^3(z) model.
**     Providing the meteorological parameters are known accurately and
**     there are no gross local effects, the predicted observed
**     coordinates should be within 0.05 arcsec (optical) or 1 arcsec
**     (radio) for a zenith distance of less than 70 degrees, better
**     than 30 arcsec (optical or radio) at 85 degrees and better
**     than 20 arcmin (optical) or 30 arcmin (radio) at the horizon.
**
**     Without refraction, the complementary functions eraAtioq and
**     eraAtoiq are self-consistent to better than 1 microarcsecond all
**     over the celestial sphere.  With refraction included, consistency
**     falls off at high zenith distances, but is still better than
**     0.05 arcsec at 85 degrees.
**
**  3) It is advisable to take great care with units, as even unlikely
**     values of the input parameters are accepted and processed in
**     accordance with the models used.
**
**  4) The CIRS RA,Dec is obtained from a star catalog mean place by
**     allowing for space motion, parallax, the Sun's gravitational lens
**     effect, annual aberration and precession-nutation.  For star
**     positions in the ICRS, these effects can be applied by means of
**     the eraAtci13 (etc.) functions.  Starting from classical "mean
**     place" systems, additional transformations will be needed first.
**
**  5) "Observed" Az,El means the position that would be seen by a
**     perfect geodetically aligned theodolite.  This is obtained from
**     the CIRS RA,Dec by allowing for Earth orientation and diurnal
**     aberration, rotating from equator to horizon coordinates, and
**     then adjusting for refraction.  The HA,Dec is obtained by
**     rotating back into equatorial coordinates, and is the position
**     that would be seen by a perfect equatorial with its polar axis
**     aligned to the Earth's axis of rotation.  Finally, the RA is
**     obtained by subtracting the HA from the local ERA.
**
**  6) The star-independent CIRS-to-observed-place parameters in ASTROM
**     may be computed with eraApio[13] or eraApco[13].  If nothing has
**     changed significantly except the time, eraAper[13] may be used to
**     perform the requisite adjustment to the astrom structure.
