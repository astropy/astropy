**
**  Frame bias components of IAU 2000 precession-nutation models (part
**  of MHB2000 with additions).
**
**  Returned:
**     dpsibi,depsbi  double  longitude and obliquity corrections
**     dra            double  the ICRS RA of the J2000.0 mean equinox
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The frame bias corrections in longitude and obliquity (radians)
**     are required in order to correct for the offset between the GCRS
**     pole and the mean J2000.0 pole.  They define, with respect to the
**     GCRS frame, a J2000.0 mean pole that is consistent with the rest
**     of the IAU 2000A precession-nutation model.
**
**  2) In addition to the displacement of the pole, the complete
**     description of the frame bias requires also an offset in right
**     ascension.  This is not part of the IAU 2000A model, and is from
**     Chapront et al. (2002).  It is returned in radians.
**
**  3) This is a supplemented implementation of one aspect of the IAU
**     2000A nutation model, formally adopted by the IAU General
**     Assembly in 2000, namely MHB2000 (Mathews et al. 2002).
