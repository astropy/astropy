**  Decompose radians into degrees, arcminutes, arcseconds, fraction.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  vector/matrix support function.
**
**  Given:
**     ndp     int     resolution (Note 1)

**     sign    char    '+' or '-'
**     idmsf   int[4]  degrees, arcminutes, arcseconds, fraction
**
**  Called:
**     iauD2tf      decompose days to hms
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The argument ndp is interpreted as follows:
**
**     ndp         resolution
**      :      ...0000 00 00
**     -7         1000 00 00
**     -6          100 00 00
**     -5           10 00 00
**     -4            1 00 00
**     -3            0 10 00
**     -2            0 01 00
**     -1            0 00 10
**      0            0 00 01
**      1            0 00 00.1

**      :            0 00 00.000...
**
**  2) The largest positive useful value for ndp is determined by the
**     size of angle, the format of doubles on the target platform, and
**     the risk of overflowing idmsf[3].  On a typical platform, for
**     angle up to 2pi, the available floating-point precision might
**     correspond to ndp=12.  However, the practical limit is typically
**     ndp=9, set by the capacity of a 32-bit int, or ndp=4 if int is
**     only 16 bits.
**
**  3) The absolute value of angle may exceed 2pi.  In cases where it
**     does not, it is up to the caller to test for and handle the
**     case where angle is very nearly 2pi and rounds up to 360 degrees,
**     by testing for idmsf[0]=360 and setting idmsf[0-3] to zero.

**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The frame bias corrections in longitude and obliquity (radians)
**     are required in order to correct for the offset between the GCRS
**     pole and the mean J2000.0 pole.  They define, with respect to the
**     GCRS frame, a J2000.0 mean pole that is consistent with the rest
**     of the IAU 2000A precession-nutation model.
**
**  2) In addition to the displacement of the pole, the complete
**     description of the frame bias requires also an offset in right
**     ascension.  This is not part of the IAU 2000A model, and is from
**     Chapront et al. (2002).  It is returned in radians.
**
**  3) This is a supplemented implementation of one aspect of the IAU
**     2000A nutation model, formally adopted by the IAU General
**     Assembly in 2000, namely MHB2000 (Mathews et al. 2002).

**     rbp          double[3][3]   bias-precession matrix (Note 4)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
**     among others:
**
**             date1         date2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  2) The matrix rb transforms vectors from GCRS to mean J2000.0 by
**     applying frame bias.
**
**  3) The matrix rp transforms vectors from J2000.0 mean equator and
**     equinox to mean equator and equinox of date by applying
**     precession.
**
**  4) The matrix rbp transforms vectors from GCRS to mean equator and
**     equinox of date by applying frame bias then precession.  It is
**     the product rp x rb.
**
**  5) It is permissible to re-use the same array in the returned
**     arguments.  The arrays are filled in the order given.

**
**  Frame bias and precession, IAU 2006.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  support function.
**
**  Given:
**     date1,date2  double         TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
**
**  Returned:
**     rb           double[3][3]   frame bias matrix (Note 2)
**     rp           double[3][3]   precession matrix (Note 3)
**     rbp          double[3][3]   bias-precession matrix (Note 4)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
**     among others:
**
**             date1         date2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  2) The matrix rb transforms vectors from GCRS to mean J2000.0 by
**     applying frame bias.
**
**  3) The matrix rp transforms vectors from mean J2000.0 to mean of
**     date by applying precession.
**
**  4) The matrix rbp transforms vectors from GCRS to mean of date by
**     applying frame bias then precession.  It is the product rp x rb.

**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,

**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  2) The matrix rc2i is the first stage in the transformation from
**     celestial to terrestrial coordinates:
**

**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  2) The Celestial Intermediate Pole coordinates are the x,y components
**     of the unit vector in the Geocentric Celestial Reference System.
**
**  3) The matrix rc2i is the first stage in the transformation from
**     celestial to terrestrial coordinates:
**
**        [TRS] = RPOM * R_3(ERA) * rc2i * [CRS]
**
**              = RC2T * [CRS]
**
**     where [CRS] is a vector in the Geocentric Celestial Reference
**     System and [TRS] is a vector in the International Terrestrial
**     Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003), ERA is the Earth
**     Rotation Angle and RPOM is the polar motion matrix.
**
**  4) Although its name does not include "00", This function is in fact
**     specific to the IAU 2000 models.

**  Returned:

**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The TT and UT1 dates tta+ttb and uta+utb are Julian Dates,
**     apportioned in any convenient way between the arguments uta and
**     utb.  For example, JD(UT1)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of
**     these ways, among others:
**
**             uta            utb
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)

**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
**     acceptable.  The J2000 and MJD methods are good compromises
**     between resolution and convenience.  In the case of uta,utb, the
**     date & time method is best matched to the Earth rotation angle
**     algorithm used:  maximum precision is delivered when the uta
**     argument is for 0hrs UT1 on the day in question and the utb
**     argument lies in the range 0 to 1, or vice versa.
**
**  2) The arguments xp and yp are the coordinates (in radians) of the
**     Celestial Intermediate Pole with respect to the International
**     Terrestrial Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003),
**     measured along the meridians to 0 and 90 deg west respectively.
**
**  3) The matrix rc2t transforms from celestial to terrestrial
**     coordinates:
**
**        [TRS] = RPOM * R_3(ERA) * RC2I * [CRS]
**
**              = rc2t * [CRS]
**
**     where [CRS] is a vector in the Geocentric Celestial Reference
**     System and [TRS] is a vector in the International Terrestrial
**     Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003), RC2I is the
**     celestial-to-intermediate matrix, ERA is the Earth rotation
**     angle and RPOM is the polar motion matrix.

**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  support function.
**
**  Given:
**     tta,ttb  double         TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
**     uta,utb  double         UT1 as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
**     xp,yp    double         coordinates of the pole (radians, Note 2)
**
**  Returned:
**     rc2t     double[3][3]   celestial-to-terrestrial matrix (Note 3)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The TT and UT1 dates tta+ttb and uta+utb are Julian Dates,
**     apportioned in any convenient way between the arguments uta and
**     utb.  For example, JD(UT1)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of
**     these ways, among others:
**
**             uta            utb
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
**     acceptable.  The J2000 and MJD methods are good compromises
**     between resolution and convenience.  In the case of uta,utb, the
**     date & time method is best matched to the Earth rotation angle
**     algorithm used:  maximum precision is delivered when the uta
**     argument is for 0hrs UT1 on the day in question and the utb
**     argument lies in the range 0 to 1, or vice versa.
**
**  2) The arguments xp and yp are the coordinates (in radians) of the
**     Celestial Intermediate Pole with respect to the International
**     Terrestrial Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003),
**     measured along the meridians to 0 and 90 deg west respectively.
**
**  3) The matrix rc2t transforms from celestial to terrestrial
**     coordinates:
**
**        [TRS] = RPOM * R_3(ERA) * RC2I * [CRS]
**
**              = rc2t * [CRS]
**
**     where [CRS] is a vector in the Geocentric Celestial Reference
**     System and [TRS] is a vector in the International Terrestrial
**     Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003), RC2I is the
**     celestial-to-intermediate matrix, ERA is the Earth rotation
**     angle and RPOM is the polar motion matrix.
**
**  4) The present function is faster, but slightly less accurate (about
**     1 mas), than the iauC2t00a function.

**     matrix.  One use of the present function is when generating a

**     Rotation Angle changes, avoiding the considerable overhead of
**     recomputing the precession-nutation more often than necessary to
**     achieve given accuracy objectives.

**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) This function constructs the rotation matrix that transforms
**     vectors in the celestial system into vectors in the terrestrial
**     system.  It does so starting from precomputed components, namely
**     the matrix which rotates from celestial coordinates to the
**     true equator and equinox of date, the Greenwich Apparent Sidereal
**     Time and the polar motion matrix.  One use of the present function
**     is when generating a series of celestial-to-terrestrial matrices
**     where only the Sidereal Time changes, avoiding the considerable
**     overhead of recomputing the precession-nutation more often than
**     necessary to achieve given accuracy objectives.
**
**  2) The relationship between the arguments is as follows:
**
**        [TRS] = rpom * R_3(gst) * rbpn * [CRS]
**
**              = rc2t * [CRS]
**
**     where [CRS] is a vector in the Geocentric Celestial Reference
**     System and [TRS] is a vector in the International Terrestrial
**     Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003).

**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's

**
**  Status:  support function.
**
**  Given:

**
**  Returned:
**     rc2t       double[3][3]  celestial-to-terrestrial matrix (Note 4)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The TT and UT1 dates tta+ttb and uta+utb are Julian Dates,
**     apportioned in any convenient way between the arguments uta and
**     utb.  For example, JD(UT1)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of
**     these ways, among others:
**
**             uta            utb
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
**     acceptable.  The J2000 and MJD methods are good compromises
**     between resolution and convenience.  In the case of uta,utb, the
**     date & time method is best matched to the Earth rotation angle
**     algorithm used:  maximum precision is delivered when the uta
**     argument is for 0hrs UT1 on the day in question and the utb
**     argument lies in the range 0 to 1, or vice versa.
**
**  2) The caller is responsible for providing the nutation components;
**     they are in longitude and obliquity, in radians and are with
**     respect to the equinox and ecliptic of date.  For high-accuracy
**     applications, free core nutation should be included as well as
**     any other relevant corrections to the position of the CIP.
**
**  3) The arguments xp and yp are the coordinates (in radians) of the
**     Celestial Intermediate Pole with respect to the International
**     Terrestrial Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003),
**     measured along the meridians to 0 and 90 deg west respectively.
**
**  4) The matrix rc2t transforms from celestial to terrestrial
**     coordinates:
**
**        [TRS] = RPOM * R_3(GST) * RBPN * [CRS]
**
**              = rc2t * [CRS]
**
**     where [CRS] is a vector in the Geocentric Celestial Reference
**     System and [TRS] is a vector in the International Terrestrial
**     Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003), RBPN is the
**     bias-precession-nutation matrix, GST is the Greenwich (apparent)
**     Sidereal Time and RPOM is the polar motion matrix.
**
**  5) Although its name does not include "00", This function is in fact
**     specific to the IAU 2000 models.
**
**  Called:
**     iauPn00      bias/precession/nutation results, IAU 2000

**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The algorithm used is valid from -4800 March 1, but this
**     implementation rejects dates before -4799 January 1.
**
**  2) The Julian Date is returned in two pieces, in the usual SOFA
**     manner, which is designed to preserve time resolution.  The
**     Julian Date is available as a single number by adding djm0 and
**     djm.
**
**  3) In early eras the conversion is from the "Proleptic Gregorian
**     Calendar";  no account is taken of the date(s) of adoption of
**     the Gregorian Calendar, nor is the AD/BC numbering convention
**     observed.

**
**  Format for output a 2-part Julian Date (or in the case of UTC a
**  quasi-JD form that includes special provision for leap seconds).
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  support function.
**
**  Given:
**     scale     char[]  time scale ID (Note 1)
**     ndp       int     resolution (Note 2)
**     d1,d2     double  time as a 2-part Julian Date (Notes 3,4)
**
**  Returned:
**     iy,im,id  int     year, month, day in Gregorian calendar (Note 5)
**     ihmsf     int[4]  hours, minutes, seconds, fraction (Note 1)
**
**  Returned (function value):
**               int     status: +1 = dubious year (Note 5)
**                                0 = OK
**                               -1 = unacceptable date (Note 6)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) scale identifies the time scale.  Only the value "UTC" (in upper
**     case) is significant, and enables handling of leap seconds (see
**     Note 4).
**
**  2) ndp is the number of decimal places in the seconds field, and can
**     have negative as well as positive values, such as:
**
**     ndp         resolution
**     -4            1 00 00
**     -3            0 10 00
**     -2            0 01 00
**     -1            0 00 10
**      0            0 00 01
**      1            0 00 00.1
**      2            0 00 00.01
**      3            0 00 00.001
**
**     The limits are platform dependent, but a safe range is -5 to +9.
**
**  3) d1+d2 is Julian Date, apportioned in any convenient way between
**     the two arguments, for example where d1 is the Julian Day Number
**     and d2 is the fraction of a day.  In the case of UTC, where the
**     use of JD is problematical, special conventions apply:  see the
**     next note.
**
**  4) JD cannot unambiguously represent UTC during a leap second unless
**     special measures are taken.  The SOFA internal convention is that
**     the quasi-JD day represents UTC days whether the length is 86399,
**     86400 or 86401 SI seconds.
**
**  5) The warning status "dubious year" flags UTCs that predate the
**     introduction of the time scale and that are too far in the future
**     to be trusted.  See iauDat for further details.
**
**  6) For calendar conventions and limitations, see iauCal2jd.
**

**     iauJd2cal    JD to Gregorian calendar

**
**  Decompose days to hours, minutes, seconds, fraction.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.

**     days    double  interval in days
**
**  Returned:
**     sign    char    '+' or '-'
**     ihmsf   int[4]  hours, minutes, seconds, fraction
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The argument ndp is interpreted as follows:
**
**     ndp         resolution
**      :      ...0000 00 00
**     -7         1000 00 00
**     -6          100 00 00
**     -5           10 00 00
**     -4            1 00 00
**     -3            0 10 00
**     -2            0 01 00
**     -1            0 00 10
**      0            0 00 01
**      1            0 00 00.1
**      2            0 00 00.01
**      3            0 00 00.001
**      :            0 00 00.000...
**
**  2) The largest positive useful value for ndp is determined by the
**     size of days, the format of double on the target platform, and
**     the risk of overflowing ihmsf[3].  On a typical platform, for
**     days up to 1.0, the available floating-point precision might
**     correspond to ndp=12.  However, the practical limit is typically
**     ndp=9, set by the capacity of a 32-bit int, or ndp=4 if int is
**     only 16 bits.
**
**  3) The absolute value of days may exceed 1.0.  In cases where it
**     does not, it is up to the caller to test for and handle the
**     case where days is very nearly 1.0 and rounds up to 24 hours,
**     by testing for ihmsf[0]=24 and setting ihmsf[0-3] to zero.

**
**  Given:
**     iy     int      UTC:  year (Notes 1 and 2)
**     im     int            month (Note 2)
**     id     int            day (Notes 2 and 3)
**     fd     double         fraction of day (Note 4)
**
**  Returned:
**     deltat double   TAI minus UTC, seconds
**
**  Returned (function value):
**            int      status (Note 5):
**                       1 = dubious year (Note 1)
**                       0 = OK
**                      -1 = bad year
**                      -2 = bad month
**                      -3 = bad day (Note 3)
**                      -4 = bad fraction (Note 4)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) UTC began at 1960 January 1.0 (JD 2436934.5) and it is improper
**     to call the function with an earlier date.  If this is attempted,
**     zero is returned together with a warning status.
**
**     Because leap seconds cannot, in principle, be predicted in
**     advance, a reliable check for dates beyond the valid range is
**     impossible.  To guard against gross errors, a year five or more
**     after the release year of the present function (see parameter
**     IYV) is considered dubious.  In this case a warning status is
**     returned but the result is computed in the normal way.
**
**     For both too-early and too-late years, the warning status is
**     j=+1.  This is distinct from the error status j=-1, which
**     signifies a year so early that JD could not be computed.
**
**  2) If the specified date is for a day which ends with a leap second,
**     the UTC-TAI value returned is for the period leading up to the
**     leap second.  If the date is for a day which begins as a leap
**     second ends, the UTC-TAI returned is for the period following the
**     leap second.
**
**  3) The day number must be in the normal calendar range, for example
**     1 through 30 for April.  The "almanac" convention of allowing
**     such dates as January 0 and December 32 is not supported in this
**     function, in order to avoid confusion near leap seconds.
**
**  4) The fraction of day is used only for dates before the
**     introduction of leap seconds, the first of which occurred at the
**     end of 1971.  It is tested for validity (zero to less than 1 is
**     the valid range) even if not used;  if invalid, zero is used and
**     status j=-4 is returned.  For many applications, setting fd to
**     zero is acceptable;  the resulting error is always less than 3 ms
**     (and occurs only pre-1972).
**
**  5) The status value returned in the case where there are multiple
**     errors refers to the first error detected.  For example, if the
**     month and day are 13 and 32 respectively, j=-2 (bad month)
**     will be returned.
**
**  6) In cases where a valid result is not available, zero is returned.

**
**  1) For dates from 1961 January 1 onwards, the expressions from the
**     file ftp://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/tai-utc.dat are used.

**                   double  TDB-TT (seconds)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
**     among others:
**
**            date1          date2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**     Although the date is, formally, barycentric dynamical time (TDB),
**     the terrestrial dynamical time (TT) can be used with no practical
**     effect on the accuracy of the prediction.
**
**  2) TT can be regarded as a coordinate time that is realized as an
**     offset of 32.184s from International Atomic Time, TAI.  TT is a
**     specific linear transformation of geocentric coordinate time TCG,
**     which is the time scale for the Geocentric Celestial Reference
**     System, GCRS.
**
**  3) TDB is a coordinate time, and is a specific linear transformation
**     of barycentric coordinate time TCB, which is the time scale for
**     the Barycentric Celestial Reference System, BCRS.
**
**  4) The difference TCG-TCB depends on the masses and positions of the
**     bodies of the solar system and the velocity of the Earth.  It is
**     dominated by a rate difference, the residual being of a periodic
**     character.  The latter, which is modeled by the present function,
**     comprises a main (annual) sinusoidal term of amplitude
**     approximately 0.00166 seconds, plus planetary terms up to about
**     20 microseconds, and lunar and diurnal terms up to 2 microseconds.
**     These effects come from the changing transverse Doppler effect
**     and gravitational red-shift as the observer (on the Earth's
**     surface) experiences variations in speed (with respect to the
**     BCRS) and gravitational potential.
**
**  5) TDB can be regarded as the same as TCB but with a rate adjustment
**     to keep it close to TT, which is convenient for many applications.
**     The history of successive attempts to define TDB is set out in
**     Resolution 3 adopted by the IAU General Assembly in 2006, which
**     defines a fixed TDB(TCB) transformation that is consistent with
**     contemporary solar-system ephemerides.  Future ephemerides will
**     imply slightly changed transformations between TCG and TCB, which
**     could introduce a linear drift between TDB and TT;  however, any
**     such drift is unlikely to exceed 1 nanosecond per century.
**
**  6) The geocentric TDB-TT model used in the present function is that of
**     Fairhead & Bretagnon (1990), in its full form.  It was originally
**     supplied by Fairhead (private communications with P.T.Wallace,
**     1990) as a Fortran subroutine.  The present C function contains an
**     adaptation of the Fairhead code.  The numerical results are
**     essentially unaffected by the changes, the differences with
**     respect to the Fairhead & Bretagnon original being at the 1e-20 s
**     level.
**
**     The topocentric part of the model is from Moyer (1981) and
**     Murray (1983), with fundamental arguments adapted from
**     Simon et al. 1994.  It is an approximation to the expression
**     ( v / c ) . ( r / c ), where v is the barycentric velocity of
**     the Earth, r is the geocentric position of the observer and
**     c is the speed of light.
**
**     By supplying zeroes for u and v, the topocentric part of the
**     model can be nullified, and the function will return the Fairhead
**     & Bretagnon result alone.
**
**  7) During the interval 1950-2050, the absolute accuracy is better
**     than +/- 3 nanoseconds relative to time ephemerides obtained by
**     direct numerical integrations based on the JPL DE405 solar system
**     ephemeris.
**
**  8) It must be stressed that the present function is merely a model,
**     and that numerical integration of solar-system ephemerides is the
**     definitive method for predicting the relationship between TCG and
**     TCB and hence between TT and TDB.

**                               +1 = dubious year (Note 6)
**                                0 = OK
**                               -1 = bad year
**                               -2 = bad month

**                               -6 = bad second (<0)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) scale identifies the time scale.  Only the value "UTC" (in upper
**     case) is significant, and enables handling of leap seconds (see
**     Note 4).
**
**  2) For calendar conventions and limitations, see iauCal2jd.
**
**  3) The sum of the results, d1+d2, is Julian Date, where normally d1
**     is the Julian Day Number and d2 is the fraction of a day.  In the
**     case of UTC, where the use of JD is problematical, special
**     conventions apply:  see the next note.
**
**  4) JD cannot unambiguously represent UTC during a leap second unless
**     special measures are taken.  The SOFA internal convention is that
**     the quasi-JD day represents UTC days whether the length is 86399,
**     86400 or 86401 SI seconds.
**
**  5) The warning status "time is after end of day" usually means that
**     the sec argument is greater than 60.0.  However, in a day ending
**     in a leap second the limit changes to 61.0 (or 59.0 in the case
**     of a negative leap second).
**
**  6) The warning status "dubious year" flags UTCs that predate the
**     introduction of the time scale and that are too far in the future
**     to be trusted.  See iauDat for further details.
**
**  7) Only in the case of continuous and regular time scales (TAI, TT,
**     TCG, TCB and TDB) is the result d1+d2 a Julian Date, strictly
**     speaking.  In the other cases (UT1 and UTC) the result must be
**     used with circumspection;  in particular the difference between
**     two such results cannot be interpreted as a precise time
**     interval.

**  The equation of the equinoxes, compatible with IAU 2000 resolutions,

**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  canonical model.
**
**  Given:
**     date1,date2  double    TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
**     epsa         double    mean obliquity (Note 2)
**     dpsi         double    nutation in longitude (Note 3)
**
**  Returned (function value):
**                  double    equation of the equinoxes (Note 4)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
**     among others:
**
**            date1          date2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  2) The obliquity, in radians, is mean of date.
**
**  3) The result, which is in radians, operates in the following sense:
**
**        Greenwich apparent ST = GMST + equation of the equinoxes
**
**  4) The result is compatible with the IAU 2000 resolutions.  For
**     further details, see IERS Conventions 2003 and Capitaine et al.

**  Equation of the equinoxes, compatible with IAU 2000 resolutions.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  support function.
**
**  Given:
**     date1,date2  double    TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
**
**  Returned (function value):
**                  double    equation of the equinoxes (Note 2)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
**     among others:
**
**            date1          date2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  2) The result, which is in radians, operates in the following sense:
**
**        Greenwich apparent ST = GMST + equation of the equinoxes
**
**  3) The result is compatible with the IAU 2000 resolutions.  For
**     further details, see IERS Conventions 2003 and Capitaine et al.
**     (2002).

**
**  Equation of the equinoxes complementary terms, consistent with
**  IAU 2000 resolutions.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  canonical model.
**
**  Given:
**     date1,date2  double   TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
**
**  Returned (function value):
**                  double   complementary terms (Note 2)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
**     among others:
**
**            date1          date2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  2) The "complementary terms" are part of the equation of the
**     equinoxes (EE), classically the difference between apparent and
**     mean Sidereal Time:
**
**        GAST = GMST + EE
**
**     with:
**
**        EE = dpsi * cos(eps)
**
**     where dpsi is the nutation in longitude and eps is the obliquity
**     of date.  However, if the rotation of the Earth were constant in
**     an inertial frame the classical formulation would lead to
**     apparent irregularities in the UT1 timescale traceable to side-
**     effects of precession-nutation.  In order to eliminate these
**     effects from UT1, "complementary terms" were introduced in 1994
**     (IAU, 1994) and took effect from 1997 (Capitaine and Gontier,
**     1993):
**
**        GAST = GMST + CT + EE
**
**     By convention, the complementary terms are included as part of
**     the equation of the equinoxes rather than as part of the mean
**     Sidereal Time.  This slightly compromises the "geometrical"
**     interpretation of mean sidereal time but is otherwise
**     inconsequential.
**
**     The present function computes CT in the above expression,
**     compatible with IAU 2000 resolutions (Capitaine et al., 2002, and
**     IERS Conventions 2003).
**
**  Called:
**     iauFal03     mean anomaly of the Moon
**     iauFalp03    mean anomaly of the Sun
**     iauFaf03     mean argument of the latitude of the Moon
**     iauFad03     mean elongation of the Moon from the Sun
**     iauFaom03    mean longitude of the Moon's ascending node
**     iauFave03    mean longitude of Venus
**     iauFae03     mean longitude of Earth
**     iauFapa03    general accumulated precession in longitude

**  - - - - - - - - -
**
**  Equation of the origins, IAU 2006 precession and IAU 2000A nutation.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  support function.
**
**  Given:
**     date1,date2  double    TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
**
**  Returned (function value):
**                  double    equation of the origins in radians
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
**     among others:
**
**            date1          date2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  2) The equation of the origins is the distance between the true
**     equinox and the celestial intermediate origin and, equivalently,
**     the difference between Earth rotation angle and Greenwich
**     apparent sidereal time (ERA-GST).  It comprises the precession
**     (since J2000.0) in right ascension plus the equation of the
**     equinoxes (including the small correction terms).

**                                            the range 1900-2100 AD
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The TDB date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TDB)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways, among
**     others:
**
**            date1          date2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in cases
**     where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
**     acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way the
**     argument is handled internally and will deliver the optimum
**     resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods are both
**     good compromises between resolution and convenience.  However,
**     the accuracy of the result is more likely to be limited by the
**     algorithm itself than the way the date has been expressed.
**
**     n.b. TT can be used instead of TDB in most applications.
**
**  2) On return, the arrays pvh and pvb contain the following:
**
**        pvh[0][0]  x       }
**        pvh[0][1]  y       } heliocentric position, AU
**        pvh[0][2]  z       }
**
**        pvh[1][0]  xdot    }
**        pvh[1][1]  ydot    } heliocentric velocity, AU/d
**        pvh[1][2]  zdot    }
**
**        pvb[0][0]  x       }
**        pvb[0][1]  y       } barycentric position, AU
**        pvb[0][2]  z       }
**
**        pvb[1][0]  xdot    }
**        pvb[1][1]  ydot    } barycentric velocity, AU/d
**        pvb[1][2]  zdot    }
**
**     The vectors are with respect to the Barycentric Celestial
**     Reference System.  The time unit is one day in TDB.
**
**  3) The function is a SIMPLIFIED SOLUTION from the planetary theory
**     VSOP2000 (X. Moisson, P. Bretagnon, 2001, Celes. Mechanics &
**     Dyn. Astron., 80, 3/4, 205-213) and is an adaptation of original
**     Fortran code supplied by P. Bretagnon (private comm., 2000).
**
**  4) Comparisons over the time span 1900-2100 with this simplified
**     solution and the JPL DE405 ephemeris give the following results:
**
**                                RMS    max
**           Heliocentric:
**              position error    3.7   11.2   km
**              velocity error    1.4    5.0   mm/s
**
**           Barycentric:
**              position error    4.6   13.4   km
**              velocity error    1.4    4.9   mm/s
**
**     Comparisons with the JPL DE406 ephemeris show that by 1800 and
**     2200 the position errors are approximately double their 1900-2100
**     size.  By 1500 and 2500 the deterioration is a factor of 10 and
**     by 1000 and 3000 a factor of 60.  The velocity accuracy falls off
**     at about half that rate.
**
**  5) It is permissible to use the same array for pvh and pvb, which
**     will receive the barycentric values.

**
**  Equation of the equinoxes, IAU 1994 model.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  canonical model.
**
**  Given:
**     date1,date2   double     TDB date (Note 1)
**
**  Returned (function value):
**                   double     equation of the equinoxes (Note 2)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
**     among others:
**
**            date1          date2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  2) The result, which is in radians, operates in the following sense:
**
**        Greenwich apparent ST = GMST + equation of the equinoxes

**               double    Earth rotation angle (radians), range 0-2pi
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The UT1 date dj1+dj2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the arguments dj1 and dj2.  For example,
**     JD(UT1)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
**     among others:
**
**             dj1            dj2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 and MJD methods are good compromises
**     between resolution and convenience.  The date & time method is
**     best matched to the algorithm used:  maximum precision is
**     delivered when the dj1 argument is for 0hrs UT1 on the day in
**     question and the dj2 argument lies in the range 0 to 1, or vice
**     versa.
**
**  2) The algorithm is adapted from Expression 22 of Capitaine et al.
**     2000.  The time argument has been expressed in days directly,
**     and, to retain precision, integer contributions have been
**     eliminated.  The same formulation is given in IERS Conventions
**     (2003), Chap. 5, Eq. 14.

**
**  Transform an FK5 (J2000.0) star position into the system of the
**  Hipparcos catalogue, assuming zero Hipparcos proper motion.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  support function.
**
**  Given:
**     r5           double   FK5 RA (radians), equinox J2000.0, at date
**     d5           double   FK5 Dec (radians), equinox J2000.0, at date
**     date1,date2  double   TDB date (Notes 1,2)
**
**  Returned:
**     rh           double   Hipparcos RA (radians)
**     dh           double   Hipparcos Dec (radians)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) This function converts a star position from the FK5 system to
**     the Hipparcos system, in such a way that the Hipparcos proper
**     motion is zero.  Because such a star has, in general, a non-zero
**     proper motion in the FK5 system, the function requires the date
**     at which the position in the FK5 system was determined.
**
**  2) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
**     among others:
**
**            date1          date2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  3) The FK5 to Hipparcos transformation is modeled as a pure
**     rotation and spin;  zonal errors in the FK5 catalogue are not
**     taken into account.
**
**  4) The position returned by this function is in the Hipparcos
**     reference system but at date date1+date2.

**
**     The n value has no significance outside the SOFA software.  For

**
**  2) The geocentric vector (xyz, given) and height (height, returned)
**     are in meters.
**
**  3) An error status -1 means that the identifier n is illegal.  An
**     error status -2 is theoretically impossible.  In all error cases,

**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  canonical transformation.

**     elong   double     longitude (radians, east +ve)
**     phi     double     latitude (geodetic, radians, Note 3)

**
**  Returned:

**                                -1 = illegal identifier (Note 3)
**                                -2 = illegal case (Note 3)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The identifier n is a number that specifies the choice of
**     reference ellipsoid.  The following are supported:
**
**        n    ellipsoid
**
**        1     WGS84
**        2     GRS80
**        3     WGS72
**
**     The n value has no significance outside the SOFA software.  For
**     convenience, symbols WGS84 etc. are defined in sofam.h.
**
**  2) The height (height, given) and the geocentric vector (xyz,
**     returned) are in meters.
**
**  3) No validation is performed on the arguments elong, phi and
**     height.  An error status -1 means that the identifier n is
**     illegal.  An error status -2 protects against cases that would
**     lead to arithmetic exceptions.  In all error cases, xyz is set
**     to zeros.
**
**  4) The inverse transformation is performed in the function iauGc2gd.

**  Notes:
**
**  1) The equatorial radius, a, can be in any units, but meters is

**     returned geocentric vector, xyz.
**
**  4) No validation is performed on individual arguments.  The error
**     status -1 protects against (unrealistic) cases that would lead
**     to arithmetic exceptions.  If an error occurs, xyz is unchanged.
**
**  5) The inverse transformation is performed in the function

**
**  6) The transformation for a standard ellipsoid (such as WGS84) can

**  Greenwich mean sidereal time (model consistent with IAU 2000
**  resolutions).
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  canonical model.
**
**  Given:
**     uta,utb    double    UT1 as a 2-part Julian Date (Notes 1,2)
**     tta,ttb    double    TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Notes 1,2)
**
**  Returned (function value):
**                double    Greenwich mean sidereal time (radians)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The UT1 and TT dates uta+utb and tta+ttb respectively, are both
**     Julian Dates, apportioned in any convenient way between the
**     argument pairs.  For example, JD=2450123.7 could be expressed in
**     any of these ways, among others:
**
**            Part A         Part B
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable (in the case of UT;  the TT is not at all critical
**     in this respect).  The J2000 and MJD methods are good compromises
**     between resolution and convenience.  For UT, the date & time
**     method is best matched to the algorithm that is used by the Earth
**     Rotation Angle function, called internally:  maximum precision is
**     delivered when the uta argument is for 0hrs UT1 on the day in
**     question and the utb argument lies in the range 0 to 1, or vice
**     versa.
**
**  2) Both UT1 and TT are required, UT1 to predict the Earth rotation
**     and TT to predict the effects of precession.  If UT1 is used for
**     both purposes, errors of order 100 microarcseconds result.
**
**  3) This GMST is compatible with the IAU 2000 resolutions and must be
**     used only in conjunction with other IAU 2000 compatible
**     components such as precession-nutation and equation of the
**     equinoxes.
**
**  4) The result is returned in the range 0 to 2pi.
**
**  5) The algorithm is from Capitaine et al. (2003) and IERS
**     Conventions 2003.

**  Greenwich mean sidereal time (consistent with IAU 2006 precession).
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  canonical model.
**
**  Given:

**     tta,ttb    double    TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Notes 1,2)
**
**  Returned (function value):
**                double    Greenwich mean sidereal time (radians)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The UT1 and TT dates uta+utb and tta+ttb respectively, are both
**     Julian Dates, apportioned in any convenient way between the
**     argument pairs.  For example, JD=2450123.7 could be expressed in
**     any of these ways, among others:
**
**            Part A        Part B
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)

**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable (in the case of UT;  the TT is not at all critical
**     in this respect).  The J2000 and MJD methods are good compromises
**     between resolution and convenience.  For UT, the date & time
**     method is best matched to the algorithm that is used by the Earth
**     rotation angle function, called internally:  maximum precision is
**     delivered when the uta argument is for 0hrs UT1 on the day in
**     question and the utb argument lies in the range 0 to 1, or vice
**     versa.
**
**  2) Both UT1 and TT are required, UT1 to predict the Earth rotation
**     and TT to predict the effects of precession.  If UT1 is used for
**     both purposes, errors of order 100 microarcseconds result.
**
**  3) This GMST is compatible with the IAU 2006 precession and must not

**
**  Returned (function value):
**                double    Greenwich mean sidereal time (radians)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The UT1 date dj1+dj2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the arguments dj1 and dj2.  For example,
**     JD(UT1)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
**     among others:
**
**             dj1            dj2
**
**         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)
**          2451545D0      -1421.3D0     (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5D0     50123.2D0     (MJD method)
**         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 and MJD methods are good compromises
**     between resolution and convenience.  The date & time method is
**     best matched to the algorithm used:  maximum accuracy (or, at
**     least, minimum noise) is delivered when the dj1 argument is for
**     0hrs UT1 on the day in question and the dj2 argument lies in the
**     range 0 to 1, or vice versa.
**
**  2) The algorithm is based on the IAU 1982 expression.  This is
**     always described as giving the GMST at 0 hours UT1.  In fact, it
**     gives the difference between the GMST and the UT, the steady
**     4-minutes-per-day drawing-ahead of ST with respect to UT.  When
**     whole days are ignored, the expression happens to equal the GMST
**     at 0 hours UT1 each day.
**
**  3) In this function, the entire UT1 (the sum of the two arguments
**     dj1 and dj2) is used directly as the argument for the standard
**     formula, the constant term of which is adjusted by 12 hours to
**     take account of the noon phasing of Julian Date.  The UT1 is then
**     added, but omitting whole days to conserve accuracy.

**
**  Greenwich apparent sidereal time (consistent with IAU 2000
**  resolutions but using the truncated nutation model IAU 2000B).
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  support function.
**
**  Given:
**     uta,utb    double    UT1 as a 2-part Julian Date (Notes 1,2)
**
**  Returned (function value):
**                double    Greenwich apparent sidereal time (radians)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The UT1 date uta+utb is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the argument pair.  For example,
**     JD=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways, among
**     others:
**
**             uta            utb
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in cases
**     where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
**     acceptable.  The J2000 and MJD methods are good compromises
**     between resolution and convenience.  For UT, the date & time
**     method is best matched to the algorithm that is used by the Earth
**     Rotation Angle function, called internally:  maximum precision is
**     delivered when the uta argument is for 0hrs UT1 on the day in
**     question and the utb argument lies in the range 0 to 1, or vice
**     versa.
**
**  2) The result is compatible with the IAU 2000 resolutions, except
**     that accuracy has been compromised for the sake of speed and
**     convenience in two respects:
**
**     . UT is used instead of TDB (or TT) to compute the precession
**       component of GMST and the equation of the equinoxes.  This
**       results in errors of order 0.1 mas at present.
**
**     . The IAU 2000B abridged nutation model (McCarthy & Luzum, 2001)
**       is used, introducing errors of up to 1 mas.
**
**  3) This GAST is compatible with the IAU 2000 resolutions and must be
**     used only in conjunction with other IAU 2000 compatible
**     components such as precession-nutation.
**
**  4) The result is returned in the range 0 to 2pi.
**
**  5) The algorithm is from Capitaine et al. (2003) and IERS
**     Conventions 2003.

**
**  Greenwich apparent sidereal time (consistent with IAU 1982/94
**  resolutions).
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  support function.
**
**  Given:
**     uta,utb    double    UT1 as a 2-part Julian Date (Notes 1,2)
**
**  Returned (function value):
**                double    Greenwich apparent sidereal time (radians)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The UT1 date uta+utb is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the argument pair.  For example,
**     JD=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways, among
**     others:
**
**             uta            utb
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in cases
**     where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
**     acceptable.  The J2000 and MJD methods are good compromises
**     between resolution and convenience.  For UT, the date & time
**     method is best matched to the algorithm that is used by the Earth
**     Rotation Angle function, called internally:  maximum precision is
**     delivered when the uta argument is for 0hrs UT1 on the day in
**     question and the utb argument lies in the range 0 to 1, or vice
**     versa.
**
**  2) The result is compatible with the IAU 1982 and 1994 resolutions,
**     except that accuracy has been compromised for the sake of
**     convenience in that UT is used instead of TDB (or TT) to compute
**     the equation of the equinoxes.
**
**  3) This GAST must be used only in conjunction with contemporaneous
**     IAU standards such as 1976 precession, 1980 obliquity and 1982
**     nutation.  It is not compatible with the IAU 2000 resolutions.
**
**  4) The result is returned in the range 0 to 2pi.

**  Called:
**     iauGmst82    Greenwich mean sidereal time, IAU 1982

**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  2) The proper motion in RA is dRA/dt rather than cos(Dec)*dRA/dt.
**
**  3) The FK5 to Hipparcos transformation is modeled as a pure rotation
**     and spin;  zonal errors in the FK5 catalogue are not taken into
**     account.
**
**  4) It was the intention that Hipparcos should be a close
**     approximation to an inertial frame, so that distant objects have
**     zero proper motion;  such objects have (in general) non-zero
**     proper motion in FK5, and this function returns those fictitious
**     proper motions.
**
**  5) The position returned by this function is in the FK5 J2000.0
**     reference system but at date date1+date2.

**
**  Returned:
**     rmatn        double[3][3]    nutation matrix
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
**     among others:
**
**            date1          date2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  2) The matrix operates in the sense V(true) = rmatn * V(mean), where
**     the p-vector V(true) is with respect to the true equatorial triad
**     of date and the p-vector V(mean) is with respect to the mean
**     equatorial triad of date.
**
**  3) A faster, but slightly less accurate result (about 1 mas), can be
**     obtained by using instead the iauNum00b function.

**
**  Nutation, IAU 2000A model (MHB2000 luni-solar and planetary nutation
**  with free core nutation omitted).
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  canonical model.
**
**  Given:
**     date1,date2   double   TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
**
**  Returned:
**     dpsi,deps     double   nutation, luni-solar + planetary (Note 2)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
**     among others:
**
**            date1          date2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  2) The nutation components in longitude and obliquity are in radians
**     and with respect to the equinox and ecliptic of date.  The
**     obliquity at J2000.0 is assumed to be the Lieske et al. (1977)
**     value of 84381.448 arcsec.
**
**     Both the luni-solar and planetary nutations are included.  The
**     latter are due to direct planetary nutations and the
**     perturbations of the lunar and terrestrial orbits.
**
**  3) The function computes the MHB2000 nutation series with the
**     associated corrections for planetary nutations.  It is an
**     implementation of the nutation part of the IAU 2000A precession-
**     nutation model, formally adopted by the IAU General Assembly in
**     2000, namely MHB2000 (Mathews et al. 2002), but with the free
**     core nutation (FCN - see Note 4) omitted.
**
**  4) The full MHB2000 model also contains contributions to the
**     nutations in longitude and obliquity due to the free-excitation
**     of the free-core-nutation during the period 1979-2000.  These FCN
**     terms, which are time-dependent and unpredictable, are NOT
**     included in the present function and, if required, must be
**     independently computed.  With the FCN corrections included, the
**     present function delivers a pole which is at current epochs
**     accurate to a few hundred microarcseconds.  The omission of FCN
**     introduces further errors of about that size.
**
**  5) The present function provides classical nutation.  The MHB2000
**     algorithm, from which it is adapted, deals also with (i) the
**     offsets between the GCRS and mean poles and (ii) the adjustments
**     in longitude and obliquity due to the changed precession rates.
**     These additional functions, namely frame bias and precession
**     adjustments, are supported by the SOFA functions iauBi00  and
**     iauPr00.
**
**  6) The MHB2000 algorithm also provides "total" nutations, comprising
**     the arithmetic sum of the frame bias, precession adjustments,
**     luni-solar nutation and planetary nutation.  These total
**     nutations can be used in combination with an existing IAU 1976
**     precession implementation, such as iauPmat76,  to deliver GCRS-
**     to-true predictions of sub-mas accuracy at current dates.
**     However, there are three shortcomings in the MHB2000 model that
**     must be taken into account if more accurate or definitive results
**     are required (see Wallace 2002):
**
**       (i) The MHB2000 total nutations are simply arithmetic sums,
**           yet in reality the various components are successive Euler
**           rotations.  This slight lack of rigor leads to cross terms
**           that exceed 1 mas after a century.  The rigorous procedure
**           is to form the GCRS-to-true rotation matrix by applying the
**           bias, precession and nutation in that order.
**
**      (ii) Although the precession adjustments are stated to be with
**           respect to Lieske et al. (1977), the MHB2000 model does
**           not specify which set of Euler angles are to be used and
**           how the adjustments are to be applied.  The most literal
**           and straightforward procedure is to adopt the 4-rotation
**           epsilon_0, psi_A, omega_A, xi_A option, and to add DPSIPR
**           to psi_A and DEPSPR to both omega_A and eps_A.
**
**     (iii) The MHB2000 model predates the determination by Chapront
**           et al. (2002) of a 14.6 mas displacement between the
**           J2000.0 mean equinox and the origin of the ICRS frame.  It
**           should, however, be noted that neglecting this displacement
**           when calculating star coordinates does not lead to a
**           14.6 mas change in right ascension, only a small second-
**           order distortion in the pattern of the precession-nutation
**           effect.
**
**     For these reasons, the SOFA functions do not generate the "total
**     nutations" directly, though they can of course easily be
**     generated by calling iauBi00, iauPr00 and the present function
**     and adding the results.
**
**  7) The MHB2000 model contains 41 instances where the same frequency
**     appears multiple times, of which 38 are duplicates and three are
**     triplicates.  To keep the present code close to the original MHB
**     algorithm, this small inefficiency has not been corrected.

**
**  Nutation, IAU 2000B model.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  canonical model.
**
**  Given:
**     date1,date2   double    TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
**
**  Returned:
**     dpsi,deps     double    nutation, luni-solar + planetary (Note 2)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
**     among others:
**
**            date1          date2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  2) The nutation components in longitude and obliquity are in radians
**     and with respect to the equinox and ecliptic of date.  The
**     obliquity at J2000.0 is assumed to be the Lieske et al. (1977)
**     value of 84381.448 arcsec.  (The errors that result from using
**     this function with the IAU 2006 value of 84381.406 arcsec can be
**     neglected.)
**
**     The nutation model consists only of luni-solar terms, but
**     includes also a fixed offset which compensates for certain long-
**     period planetary terms (Note 7).
**
**  3) This function is an implementation of the IAU 2000B abridged
**     nutation model formally adopted by the IAU General Assembly in
**     2000.  The function computes the MHB_2000_SHORT luni-solar
**     nutation series (Luzum 2001), but without the associated
**     corrections for the precession rate adjustments and the offset
**     between the GCRS and J2000.0 mean poles.
**
**  4) The full IAU 2000A (MHB2000) nutation model contains nearly 1400
**     terms.  The IAU 2000B model (McCarthy & Luzum 2003) contains only
**     77 terms, plus additional simplifications, yet still delivers
**     results of 1 mas accuracy at present epochs.  This combination of
**     accuracy and size makes the IAU 2000B abridged nutation model
**     suitable for most practical applications.
**
**     The function delivers a pole accurate to 1 mas from 1900 to 2100
**     (usually better than 1 mas, very occasionally just outside
**     1 mas).  The full IAU 2000A model, which is implemented in the
**     function iauNut00a (q.v.), delivers considerably greater accuracy
**     at current dates;  however, to realize this improved accuracy,
**     corrections for the essentially unpredictable free-core-nutation
**     (FCN) must also be included.
**
**  5) The present function provides classical nutation.  The
**     MHB_2000_SHORT algorithm, from which it is adapted, deals also
**     with (i) the offsets between the GCRS and mean poles and (ii) the
**     adjustments in longitude and obliquity due to the changed
**     precession rates.  These additional functions, namely frame bias
**     and precession adjustments, are supported by the SOFA functions
**     iauBi00  and iauPr00.
**
**  6) The MHB_2000_SHORT algorithm also provides "total" nutations,
**     comprising the arithmetic sum of the frame bias, precession
**     adjustments, and nutation (luni-solar + planetary).  These total
**     nutations can be used in combination with an existing IAU 1976
**     precession implementation, such as iauPmat76,  to deliver GCRS-
**     to-true predictions of mas accuracy at current epochs.  However,
**     for symmetry with the iauNut00a  function (q.v. for the reasons),
**     the SOFA functions do not generate the "total nutations"
**     directly.  Should they be required, they could of course easily
**     be generated by calling iauBi00, iauPr00 and the present function
**     and adding the results.
**
**  7) The IAU 2000B model includes "planetary bias" terms that are
**     fixed in size but compensate for long-period nutations.  The
**     amplitudes quoted in McCarthy & Luzum (2003), namely
**     Dpsi = -1.5835 mas and Depsilon = +1.6339 mas, are optimized for
**     the "total nutations" method described in Note 6.  The Luzum
**     (2001) values used in this SOFA implementation, namely -0.135 mas
**     and +0.388 mas, are optimized for the "rigorous" method, where
**     frame bias, precession and nutation are applied separately and in
**     that order.  During the interval 1995-2050, the SOFA
**     implementation delivers a maximum error of 1.001 mas (not
**     including FCN).

**  IAU 2000A nutation with adjustments to match the IAU 2006
**  precession.
**
**  Given:
**     date1,date2   double   TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
**
**  Returned:
**     dpsi,deps     double   nutation, luni-solar + planetary (Note 2)
**
**  Status:  canonical model.
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
**     among others:
**
**            date1          date2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  2) The nutation components in longitude and obliquity are in radians
**     and with respect to the mean equinox and ecliptic of date,
**     IAU 2006 precession model (Hilton et al. 2006, Capitaine et al.
**     2005).
**
**  3) The function first computes the IAU 2000A nutation, then applies
**     adjustments for (i) the consequences of the change in obliquity
**     from the IAU 1980 ecliptic to the IAU 2006 ecliptic and (ii) the
**     secular variation in the Earth's dynamical form factor J2.
**
**  4) The present function provides classical nutation, complementing
**     the IAU 2000 frame bias and IAU 2006 precession.  It delivers a
**     pole which is at current epochs accurate to a few tens of
**     microarcseconds, apart from the free core nutation.

**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
**     with the following requirements:
**
**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
**        endorsed by SOFA.
**
**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
**        from the original SOFA software.
**
**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
**        thereof such as changes of case.
**
**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
**
**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
**        derived work.
**
**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
**     such, as explained above.
**
**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
**     by inappropriate modification.
**
**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the
**     SOFA software.  SOFA makes no warranties, express or implied, as
**     to non-infringement of third party rights, merchantability, or
**     fitness for any particular purpose.  In no event will SOFA be
**     liable to the user for any consequential, incidental, or special
**     damages, including any lost profits or lost savings, even if a
**     SOFA representative has been advised of such damages, or for any
**     claim by any third party.
**
**  6. The provision of any version of the SOFA software under the terms
**     and conditions specified herein does not imply that future
**     versions will also be made available under the same terms and

**  Nutation, IAU 1980 model.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  canonical model.
**
**  Given:
**     date1,date2   double    TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
**
**  Returned:
**     dpsi          double    nutation in longitude (radians)
**     deps          double    nutation in obliquity (radians)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
**     among others:
**
**            date1          date2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  2) The nutation components are with respect to the ecliptic of
**     date.

**  Form the matrix of nutation for a given date, IAU 1980 model.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  support function.
**

**

**     rmatn          double[3][3]    nutation matrix
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
**     among others:
**
**            date1          date2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  2) The matrix operates in the sense V(true) = rmatn * V(mean),
**     where the p-vector V(true) is with respect to the true
**     equatorial triad of date and the p-vector V(mean) is with
**     respect to the mean equatorial triad of date.

**  Mean obliquity of the ecliptic, IAU 1980 model.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  canonical model.
**
**  Given:
**     date1,date2   double    TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
**
**  Returned (function value):
**                   double    obliquity of the ecliptic (radians, Note 2)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
**     among others:
**
**            date1          date2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  2) The result is the angle between the ecliptic and mean equator of
**     date date1+date2.

**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
**     among others:
**
**            date1          date2
**

**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  2) This function returns the set of equinox based angles for the
**     Capitaine et al. "P03" precession theory, adopted by the IAU in
**     2006.  The angles are set out in Table 1 of Hilton et al. (2006):
**
**     eps0   epsilon_0   obliquity at J2000.0
**     psia   psi_A       luni-solar precession
**     oma    omega_A     inclination of equator wrt J2000.0 ecliptic
**     bpa    P_A         ecliptic pole x, J2000.0 ecliptic triad
**     bqa    Q_A         ecliptic pole -y, J2000.0 ecliptic triad
**     pia    pi_A        angle between moving and J2000.0 ecliptics
**     bpia   Pi_A        longitude of ascending node of the ecliptic
**     epsa   epsilon_A   obliquity of the ecliptic
**     chia   chi_A       planetary precession
**     za     z_A         equatorial precession: -3rd 323 Euler angle
**     zetaa  zeta_A      equatorial precession: -1st 323 Euler angle
**     thetaa theta_A     equatorial precession: 2nd 323 Euler angle
**     pa     p_A         general precession
**     gam    gamma_J2000 J2000.0 RA difference of ecliptic poles
**     phi    phi_J2000   J2000.0 codeclination of ecliptic pole
**     psi    psi_J2000   longitude difference of equator poles, J2000.0
**
**     The returned values are all radians.
**
**  3) Hilton et al. (2006) Table 1 also contains angles that depend on
**     models distinct from the P03 precession theory itself, namely the
**     IAU 2000A frame bias and nutation.  The quoted polynomials are
**     used in other SOFA functions:
**
**     . iauXy06  contains the polynomial parts of the X and Y series.
**
**     . iauS06  contains the polynomial part of the s+XY/2 series.
**
**     . iauPfw06  implements the series for the Fukushima-Williams
**       angles that are with respect to the GCRS pole (i.e. the variants
**       that include frame bias).
**
**  4) The IAU resolution stipulated that the choice of parameterization
**     was left to the user, and so an IAU compliant precession
**     implementation can be constructed using various combinations of
**     the angles returned by the present function.
**
**  5) The parameterization used by SOFA is the version of the Fukushima-
**     Williams angles that refers directly to the GCRS pole.  These
**     angles may be calculated by calling the function iauPfw06.  SOFA
**     also supports the direct computation of the CIP GCRS X,Y by
**     series, available by calling iauXy06.
**
**  6) The agreement between the different parameterizations is at the
**     1 microarcsecond level in the present era.
**
**  7) When constructing a precession formulation that refers to the GCRS
**     pole rather than the dynamical pole, it may (depending on the
**     choice of angles) be necessary to introduce the frame bias
**     explicitly.
**
**  8) It is permissible to re-use the same variable in the returned
**     arguments.  The quantities are stored in the stated order.

**
**  This function forms three Euler angles which implement general
**  precession from epoch J2000.0, using the IAU 2006 model.  Frame
**  bias (the offset between ICRS and mean J2000.0) is included.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  support function.
**
**  Given:
**     date1,date2  double   TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
**
**  Returned:
**     bzeta        double   1st rotation: radians cw around z
**     bz           double   3rd rotation: radians cw around z
**     btheta       double   2nd rotation: radians ccw around y
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
**     among others:
**
**            date1          date2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  2) The traditional accumulated precession angles zeta_A, z_A,
**     theta_A cannot be obtained in the usual way, namely through
**     polynomial expressions, because of the frame bias.  The latter
**     means that two of the angles undergo rapid changes near this
**     date.  They are instead the results of decomposing the
**     precession-bias matrix obtained by using the Fukushima-Williams
**     method, which does not suffer from the problem.  The
**     decomposition returns values which can be used in the
**     conventional formulation and which include frame bias.
**
**  3) The three angles are returned in the conventional order, which
**     is not the same as the order of the corresponding Euler
**     rotations.  The precession-bias matrix is
**     R_3(-z) x R_2(+theta) x R_3(-zeta).
**
**  4) Should zeta_A, z_A, theta_A angles be required that do not
**     contain frame bias, they are available by calling the SOFA
**     function iauP06e.

**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,

**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  2) Naming the following points:
**
**           e = J2000.0 ecliptic pole,
**           p = GCRS pole,
**           E = mean ecliptic pole of date,

**        phib = phi_bar = pE
**        psib = psi_bar = pEP
**        epsa = epsilon_A = EP
**
**  3) The matrix representing the combined effects of frame bias and
**     precession is:
**
**        PxB = R_1(-epsa).R_3(-psib).R_1(phib).R_3(gamb)
**
**  4) The matrix representing the combined effects of frame bias,
**     precession and nutation is simply:
**
**        NxPxB = R_1(-epsa-dE).R_3(-psib-dP).R_1(phib).R_3(gamb)
**
**     where dP and dE are the nutation components with respect to the

**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  support function.
**
**  Approximate heliocentric position and velocity of a nominated major
**  planet:  Mercury, Venus, EMB, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus or
**  Neptune (but not the Earth itself).
**
**  Given:
**     date1  double       TDB date part A (Note 1)
**     date2  double       TDB date part B (Note 1)
**     np     int          planet (1=Mercury, 2=Venus, 3=EMB, 4=Mars,
**                             5=Jupiter, 6=Saturn, 7=Uranus, 8=Neptune)
**
**  Returned (argument):
**     pv     double[3][2] planet p,v (heliocentric, J2000.0, AU,AU/d)
**
**  Returned (function value):
**            int          status: -1 = illegal NP (outside 1-8)
**                                  0 = OK
**                                 +1 = warning: year outside 1000-3000
**                                 +2 = warning: failed to converge
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The date date1+date2 is in the TDB time scale (in practice TT can
**     be used) and is a Julian Date, apportioned in any convenient way
**     between the two arguments.  For example, JD(TDB)=2450123.7 could
**     be expressed in any of these ways, among others:
**
**            date1          date2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in cases
**     where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
**     acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way the
**     argument is handled internally and will deliver the optimum
**     resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods are both
**     good compromises between resolution and convenience.  The limited
**     accuracy of the present algorithm is such that any of the methods
**     is satisfactory.
**
**  2) If an np value outside the range 1-8 is supplied, an error status
**     (function value -1) is returned and the pv vector set to zeroes.
**
**  3) For np=3 the result is for the Earth-Moon Barycenter.  To obtain
**     the heliocentric position and velocity of the Earth, use instead
**     the SOFA function iauEpv00.
**
**  4) On successful return, the array pv contains the following:
**
**        pv[0][0]   x      }
**        pv[1][0]   y      } heliocentric position, AU
**        pv[2][0]   z      }
**
**        pv[0][1]   xdot   }
**        pv[1][1]   ydot   } heliocentric velocity, AU/d
**        pv[2][1]   zdot   }
**
**     The reference frame is equatorial and is with respect to the
**     mean equator and equinox of epoch J2000.0.
**
**  5) The algorithm is due to J.L. Simon, P. Bretagnon, J. Chapront,
**     M. Chapront-Touze, G. Francou and J. Laskar (Bureau des
**     Longitudes, Paris, France).  From comparisons with JPL
**     ephemeris DE102, they quote the following maximum errors
**     over the interval 1800-2050:
**
**                     L (arcsec)    B (arcsec)      R (km)
**
**        Mercury          4             1             300
**        Venus            5             1             800
**        EMB              6             1            1000
**        Mars            17             1            7700
**        Jupiter         71             5           76000
**        Saturn          81            13          267000
**        Uranus          86             7          712000
**        Neptune         11             1          253000
**
**     Over the interval 1000-3000, they report that the accuracy is no
**     worse than 1.5 times that over 1800-2050.  Outside 1000-3000 the
**     accuracy declines.
**
**     Comparisons of the present function with the JPL DE200 ephemeris
**     give the following RMS errors over the interval 1960-2025:
**
**                      position (km)     velocity (m/s)
**
**        Mercury            334               0.437
**        Venus             1060               0.855
**        EMB               2010               0.815
**        Mars              7690               1.98
**        Jupiter          71700               7.70
**        Saturn          199000              19.4
**        Uranus          564000              16.4
**        Neptune         158000              14.4
**
**     Comparisons against DE200 over the interval 1800-2100 gave the
**     following maximum absolute differences.  (The results using
**     DE406 were essentially the same.)
**
**                   L (arcsec)   B (arcsec)     R (km)   Rdot (m/s)
**
**        Mercury        7            1            500       0.7
**        Venus          7            1           1100       0.9
**        EMB            9            1           1300       1.0
**        Mars          26            1           9000       2.5
**        Jupiter       78            6          82000       8.2
**        Saturn        87           14         263000      24.6
**        Uranus        86            7         661000      27.4
**        Neptune       11            2         248000      21.4
**
**  6) The present SOFA re-implementation of the original Simon et al.
**     Fortran code differs from the original in the following respects:
**
**       *  C instead of Fortran.
**
**       *  The date is supplied in two parts.
**
**       *  The result is returned only in equatorial Cartesian form;
**          the ecliptic longitude, latitude and radius vector are not
**          returned.
**
**       *  The result is in the J2000.0 equatorial frame, not ecliptic.
**
**       *  More is done in-line: there are fewer calls to subroutines.
**
**       *  Different error/warning status values are used.
**
**       *  A different Kepler's-equation-solver is used (avoiding
**          use of double precision complex).
**
**       *  Polynomials in t are nested to minimize rounding errors.
**
**       *  Explicit double constants are used to avoid mixed-mode
**          expressions.
**
**     None of the above changes affects the result significantly.
**
**  7) The returned status indicates the most serious condition
**     encountered during execution of the function.  Illegal np is
**     considered the most serious, overriding failure to converge,
**     which in turn takes precedence over the remote date warning.

**  Precession matrix (including frame bias) from GCRS to a specified
**  date, IAU 2000 model.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  support function.

**
**  Returned:
**     rbp          double[3][3]    bias-precession matrix (Note 2)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
**     among others:
**
**            date1          date2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  2) The matrix operates in the sense V(date) = rbp * V(GCRS), where
**     the p-vector V(GCRS) is with respect to the Geocentric Celestial
**     Reference System (IAU, 2000) and the p-vector V(date) is with
**     respect to the mean equatorial triad of the given date.

**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  support function.
**
**  Given:
**     date1,date2  double          TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
**     dpsi,deps    double          nutation (Note 2)

**     rbpn         double[3][3]    GCRS-to-true matrix (Note 8)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
**     among others:
**
**            date1          date2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  2) The caller is responsible for providing the nutation components;
**     they are in longitude and obliquity, in radians and are with
**     respect to the equinox and ecliptic of date.  For high-accuracy
**     applications, free core nutation should be included as well as
**     any other relevant corrections to the position of the CIP.
**
**  3) The returned mean obliquity is consistent with the IAU 2000
**     precession-nutation models.
**
**  4) The matrix rb transforms vectors from GCRS to J2000.0 mean
**     equator and equinox by applying frame bias.
**
**  5) The matrix rp transforms vectors from J2000.0 mean equator and
**     equinox to mean equator and equinox of date by applying
**     precession.
**
**  6) The matrix rbp transforms vectors from GCRS to mean equator and
**     equinox of date by applying frame bias then precession.  It is
**     the product rp x rb.
**
**  7) The matrix rn transforms vectors from mean equator and equinox of
**     date to true equator and equinox of date by applying the nutation
**     (luni-solar + planetary).
**
**  8) The matrix rbpn transforms vectors from GCRS to true equator and
**     equinox of date.  It is the product rn x rbp, applying frame
**     bias, precession and nutation in that order.
**
**  9) It is permissible to re-use the same array in the returned
**     arguments.  The arrays are filled in the order given.

**          2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**      The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**      cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**      is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**      the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**      optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**      are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  2)  The nutation components (luni-solar + planetary, IAU 2000A) in
**      longitude and obliquity are in radians and with respect to the
**      equinox and ecliptic of date.  Free core nutation is omitted;
**      for the utmost accuracy, use the iauPn00  function, where the
**      nutation components are caller-specified.  For faster but
**      slightly less accurate results, use the iauPn00b function.
**
**  3)  The mean obliquity is consistent with the IAU 2000 precession.
**
**  4)  The matrix rb transforms vectors from GCRS to J2000.0 mean
**      equator and equinox by applying frame bias.
**
**  5)  The matrix rp transforms vectors from J2000.0 mean equator and
**      equinox to mean equator and equinox of date by applying
**      precession.
**
**  6)  The matrix rbp transforms vectors from GCRS to mean equator and
**      equinox of date by applying frame bias then precession.  It is
**      the product rp x rb.
**
**  7)  The matrix rn transforms vectors from mean equator and equinox
**      of date to true equator and equinox of date by applying the
**      nutation (luni-solar + planetary).
**
**  8)  The matrix rbpn transforms vectors from GCRS to true equator and
**      equinox of date.  It is the product rn x rbp, applying frame
**      bias, precession and nutation in that order.
**
**  9)  The X,Y,Z coordinates of the IAU 2000B Celestial Intermediate
**      Pole are elements (3,1-3) of the matrix rbpn.

**
**  Notes:
**
**  1)  The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any

**      JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,

**  Precession-nutation, IAU 2006/2000A models:  a multi-purpose function,

**  indirectly.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  support function.
**
**  Given:
**     date1,date2  double          TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
**
**  Returned:

**     rbpn         double[3][3]    GCRS-to-true matrix (Notes 8,9)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1)  The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**      convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**      JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
**      among others:
**
**             date1          date2
**
**          2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**          2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**          2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**          2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**      The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**      cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**      is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**      the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**      optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**      are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  2)  The nutation components (luni-solar + planetary, IAU 2000A) in
**      longitude and obliquity are in radians and with respect to the
**      equinox and ecliptic of date.  Free core nutation is omitted;
**      for the utmost accuracy, use the iauPn06 function, where the
**      nutation components are caller-specified.
**
**  3)  The mean obliquity is consistent with the IAU 2006 precession.
**
**  4)  The matrix rb transforms vectors from GCRS to mean J2000.0 by
**      applying frame bias.
**
**  5)  The matrix rp transforms vectors from mean J2000.0 to mean of
**      date by applying precession.
**
**  6)  The matrix rbp transforms vectors from GCRS to mean of date by
**      applying frame bias then precession.  It is the product rp x rb.
**
**  7)  The matrix rn transforms vectors from mean of date to true of
**      date by applying the nutation (luni-solar + planetary).
**
**  8)  The matrix rbpn transforms vectors from GCRS to true of date
**      (CIP/equinox).  It is the product rn x rbp, applying frame bias,
**      precession and nutation in that order.
**
**  9)  The X,Y,Z coordinates of the IAU 2006/2000A Celestial
**      Intermediate Pole are elements (1,1-3) of the matrix rbpn.
**
**  10) It is permissible to re-use the same array in the returned
**      arguments.  The arrays are filled in the stated order.

**  Form the matrix of precession-nutation for a given date (including

**
**  Returned:
**     rnpb        double[3][3] bias-precession-nutation matrix (Note 2)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
**     among others:
**
**            date1          date2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)

**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  2) The matrix operates in the sense V(date) = rnpb * V(GCRS), where
**     the p-vector V(date) is with respect to the true equatorial triad
**     of date date1+date2 and the p-vector V(GCRS) is with respect to
**     the Geocentric Celestial Reference System (IAU, 2000).

**     positions the Terrestrial Intermediate Origin on the equator.  It
**     is obtained from polar motion observations by numerical
**     integration, and so is in essence unpredictable.  However, it is
**     dominated by a secular drift of about 47 microarcseconds per
**     century, and so can be taken into account by using s' = -47*t,
**     where t is centuries since J2000.0.  The function iauSp00
**     implements this approximation.
**
**  3) The matrix operates in the sense V(TRS) = rpom * V(CIP), meaning
**     that it is the final rotation when computing the pointing
**     direction to a celestial source.

**
**  Precession-rate part of the IAU 2000 precession-nutation models
**  (part of MHB2000).
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's

**
**  Status:  canonical model.

**
**  Returned:
**     dpsipr,depspr  double  precession corrections (Notes 2,3)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
**     among others:
**
**            date1          date2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  2) The precession adjustments are expressed as "nutation
**     components", corrections in longitude and obliquity with respect
**     to the J2000.0 equinox and ecliptic.
**
**  3) Although the precession adjustments are stated to be with respect
**     to Lieske et al. (1977), the MHB2000 model does not specify which
**     set of Euler angles are to be used and how the adjustments are to
**     be applied.  The most literal and straightforward procedure is to
**     adopt the 4-rotation epsilon_0, psi_A, omega_A, xi_A option, and
**     to add dpsipr to psi_A and depspr to both omega_A and eps_A.
**
**  4) This is an implementation of one aspect of the IAU 2000A nutation
**     model, formally adopted by the IAU General Assembly in 2000,
**     namely MHB2000 (Mathews et al. 2002).

**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The epochs ep01+ep02 and ep11+ep12 are Julian Dates, apportioned
**     in any convenient way between the arguments epn1 and epn2.  For
**     example, JD(TDB)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these

**
**             epn1          epn2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)

**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in cases

**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**     The two epochs may be expressed using different methods, but at
**     the risk of losing some resolution.
**
**  2) The accumulated precession angles zeta, z, theta are expressed
**     through canonical polynomials which are valid only for a limited
**     time span.  In addition, the IAU 1976 precession rate is known to

**     is better than 0.1 arcsec from 1960AD to 2040AD, better than
**     1 arcsec from 1640AD to 2360AD, and remains below 3 arcsec for
**     the whole of the period 500BC to 3000AD.  The errors exceed
**     10 arcsec outside the range 1200BC to 3900AD, exceed 100 arcsec

**                             -2 = null position vector
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The specified pv-vector is the coordinate direction (and its rate
**     of change) for the date at which the light leaving the star
**     reached the solar-system barycenter.
**
**  2) The star data returned by this function are "observables" for an
**     imaginary observer at the solar-system barycenter.  Proper motion
**     and radial velocity are, strictly, in terms of barycentric
**     coordinate time, TCB.  For most practical applications, it is
**     permissible to neglect the distinction between TCB and ordinary
**     "proper" time on Earth (TT/TAI).  The result will, as a rule, be
**     limited by the intrinsic accuracy of the proper-motion and
**     radial-velocity data;  moreover, the supplied pv-vector is likely
**     to be merely an intermediate result (for example generated by the
**     function iauStarpv), so that a change of time unit will cancel
**     out overall.
**
**     In accordance with normal star-catalog conventions, the object's
**     right ascension and declination are freed from the effects of
**     secular aberration.  The frame, which is aligned to the catalog
**     equator and equinox, is Lorentzian and centered on the SSB.
**
**     Summarizing, the specified pv-vector is for most stars almost
**     identical to the result of applying the standard geometrical
**     "space motion" transformation to the catalog data.  The
**     differences, which are the subject of the Stumpff paper cited
**     below, are:
**
**     (i) In stars with significant radial velocity and proper motion,
**     the constantly changing light-time distorts the apparent proper
**     motion.  Note that this is a classical, not a relativistic,
**     effect.
**
**     (ii) The transformation complies with special relativity.
**
**  3) Care is needed with units.  The star coordinates are in radians
**     and the proper motions in radians per Julian year, but the
**     parallax is in arcseconds; the radial velocity is in km/s, but
**     the pv-vector result is in AU and AU/day.
**
**  4) The proper motions are the rate of change of the right ascension
**     and declination at the catalog epoch and are in radians per Julian
**     year.  The RA proper motion is in terms of coordinate angle, not
**     true angle, and will thus be numerically larger at high
**     declinations.
**
**  5) Straight-line motion at constant speed in the inertial frame is
**     assumed.  If the speed is greater than or equal to the speed of
**     light, the function aborts with an error status.
**
**  6) The inverse transformation is performed by the function iauStarpv.

**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) A rotation matrix describes a rotation through some angle about
**     some arbitrary axis called the Euler axis.  The "rotation vector"
**     returned by this function has the same direction as the Euler axis,
**     and its magnitude is the angle in radians.  (The magnitude and
**     direction can be separated by means of the function iauPn.)
**
**  2) If r is null, so is the result.  If r is not a rotation matrix
**     the result is undefined;  r must be proper (i.e. have a positive
**     determinant) and real orthogonal (inverse = transpose).
**
**  3) The reference frame rotates clockwise as seen looking along
**     the rotation vector from the origin.

**
**  The CIO locator s, positioning the Celestial Intermediate Origin on
**  the equator of the Celestial Intermediate Pole, given the CIP's X,Y
**  coordinates.  Compatible with IAU 2000A precession-nutation.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  canonical model.
**
**  Given:
**     date1,date2   double    TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
**     x,y           double    CIP coordinates (Note 3)
**
**  Returned (function value):
**                   double    the CIO locator s in radians (Note 2)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
**     among others:
**
**            date1          date2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  2) The CIO locator s is the difference between the right ascensions
**     of the same point in two systems:  the two systems are the GCRS
**     and the CIP,CIO, and the point is the ascending node of the
**     CIP equator.  The quantity s remains below 0.1 arcsecond
**     throughout 1900-2100.
**
**  3) The series used to compute s is in fact for s+XY/2, where X and Y
**     are the x and y components of the CIP unit vector;  this series
**     is more compact than a direct series for s would be.  This
**     function requires X,Y to be supplied by the caller, who is
**     responsible for providing values that are consistent with the
**     supplied date.
**
**  4) The model is consistent with the IAU 2000A precession-nutation.

**
**  The CIO locator s, positioning the Celestial Intermediate Origin on
**  the equator of the Celestial Intermediate Pole, using the IAU 2000A
**  precession-nutation model.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  support function.
**
**  Given:
**     date1,date2  double    TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
**
**  Returned (function value):
**                  double    the CIO locator s in radians (Note 2)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
**     among others:
**
**            date1          date2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  2) The CIO locator s is the difference between the right ascensions
**     of the same point in two systems.  The two systems are the GCRS
**     and the CIP,CIO, and the point is the ascending node of the
**     CIP equator.  The CIO locator s remains a small fraction of
**     1 arcsecond throughout 1900-2100.
**
**  3) The series used to compute s is in fact for s+XY/2, where X and Y
**     are the x and y components of the CIP unit vector;  this series
**     is more compact than a direct series for s would be.  The present
**     function uses the full IAU 2000A nutation model when predicting
**     the CIP position.  Faster results, with no significant loss of
**     accuracy, can be obtained via the function iauS00b, which uses
**     instead the IAU 2000B truncated model.

**
**  The CIO locator s, positioning the Celestial Intermediate Origin on
**  the equator of the Celestial Intermediate Pole, using the IAU 2006
**  precession and IAU 2000A nutation models.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  support function.
**
**  Given:
**     date1,date2  double    TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
**
**  Returned (function value):
**                  double    the CIO locator s in radians (Note 2)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
**     among others:
**
**            date1          date2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  2) The CIO locator s is the difference between the right ascensions
**     of the same point in two systems.  The two systems are the GCRS
**     and the CIP,CIO, and the point is the ascending node of the
**     CIP equator.  The CIO locator s remains a small fraction of
**     1 arcsecond throughout 1900-2100.
**
**  3) The series used to compute s is in fact for s+XY/2, where X and Y
**     are the x and y components of the CIP unit vector;  this series is
**     more compact than a direct series for s would be.  The present
**     function uses the full IAU 2000A nutation model when predicting
**     the CIP position.
**
**  Called:
**     iauPnm06a    classical NPB matrix, IAU 2006/2000A
**     iauBpn2xy    extract CIP X,Y coordinates from NPB matrix

**  The TIO locator s', positioning the Terrestrial Intermediate Origin
**  on the equator of the Celestial Intermediate Pole.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  canonical model.

**
**  Returned (function value):
**                  double    the TIO locator s' in radians (Note 2)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
**     among others:
**
**            date1          date2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  2) The TIO locator s' is obtained from polar motion observations by
**     numerical integration, and so is in essence unpredictable.
**     However, it is dominated by a secular drift of about
**     47 microarcseconds per century, which is the approximation
**     evaluated by the present function.

**                        else = binary logical OR of the above warnings
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The starting and ending TDB dates ep1a+ep1b and ep2a+ep2b are
**     Julian Dates, apportioned in any convenient way between the two
**     parts (A and B).  For example, JD(TDB)=2450123.7 could be
**     expressed in any of these ways, among others:
**
**             epna          epnb
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  2) In accordance with normal star-catalog conventions, the object's
**     right ascension and declination are freed from the effects of
**     secular aberration.  The frame, which is aligned to the catalog
**     equator and equinox, is Lorentzian and centered on the SSB.
**
**     The proper motions are the rate of change of the right ascension
**     and declination at the catalog epoch and are in radians per TDB
**     Julian year.
**
**     The parallax and radial velocity are in the same frame.
**
**  3) Care is needed with units.  The star coordinates are in radians
**     and the proper motions in radians per Julian year, but the
**     parallax is in arcseconds.
**
**  4) The RA proper motion is in terms of coordinate angle, not true
**     angle.  If the catalog uses arcseconds for both RA and Dec proper
**     motions, the RA proper motion will need to be divided by cos(Dec)
**     before use.
**
**  5) Straight-line motion at constant speed, in the inertial frame,
**     is assumed.
**
**  6) An extremely small (or zero or negative) parallax is interpreted
**     to mean that the object is on the "celestial sphere", the radius
**     of which is an arbitrary (large) value (see the iauStarpv
**     function for the value used).  When the distance is overridden in
**     this way, the status, initially zero, has 1 added to it.
**
**  7) If the space velocity is a significant fraction of c (see the
**     constant VMAX in the function iauStarpv),  it is arbitrarily set
**     to zero.  When this action occurs, 2 is added to the status.
**
**  8) The relativistic adjustment carried out in the iauStarpv function
**     involves an iterative calculation.  If the process fails to
**     converge within a set number of iterations, 4 is added to the
**     status.

**                           else = binary logical OR of the above
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The star data accepted by this function are "observables" for an
**     imaginary observer at the solar-system barycenter.  Proper motion
**     and radial velocity are, strictly, in terms of barycentric
**     coordinate time, TCB.  For most practical applications, it is
**     permissible to neglect the distinction between TCB and ordinary
**     "proper" time on Earth (TT/TAI).  The result will, as a rule, be
**     limited by the intrinsic accuracy of the proper-motion and
**     radial-velocity data;  moreover, the pv-vector is likely to be
**     merely an intermediate result, so that a change of time unit
**     would cancel out overall.
**
**     In accordance with normal star-catalog conventions, the object's
**     right ascension and declination are freed from the effects of
**     secular aberration.  The frame, which is aligned to the catalog
**     equator and equinox, is Lorentzian and centered on the SSB.
**
**  2) The resulting position and velocity pv-vector is with respect to
**     the same frame and, like the catalog coordinates, is freed from
**     the effects of secular aberration.  Should the "coordinate
**     direction", where the object was located at the catalog epoch, be
**     required, it may be obtained by calculating the magnitude of the
**     position vector pv[0][0-2] dividing by the speed of light in
**     AU/day to give the light-time, and then multiplying the space
**     velocity pv[1][0-2] by this light-time and adding the result to
**     pv[0][0-2].
**
**     Summarizing, the pv-vector returned is for most stars almost
**     identical to the result of applying the standard geometrical
**     "space motion" transformation.  The differences, which are the
**     subject of the Stumpff paper referenced below, are:
**
**     (i) In stars with significant radial velocity and proper motion,
**     the constantly changing light-time distorts the apparent proper
**     motion.  Note that this is a classical, not a relativistic,
**     effect.
**
**     (ii) The transformation complies with special relativity.
**
**  3) Care is needed with units.  The star coordinates are in radians
**     and the proper motions in radians per Julian year, but the
**     parallax is in arcseconds; the radial velocity is in km/s, but
**     the pv-vector result is in AU and AU/day.
**
**  4) The RA proper motion is in terms of coordinate angle, not true
**     angle.  If the catalog uses arcseconds for both RA and Dec proper
**     motions, the RA proper motion will need to be divided by cos(Dec)
**     before use.
**
**  5) Straight-line motion at constant speed, in the inertial frame,
**     is assumed.
**
**  6) An extremely small (or zero or negative) parallax is interpreted
**     to mean that the object is on the "celestial sphere", the radius
**     of which is an arbitrary (large) value (see the constant PXMIN).
**     When the distance is overridden in this way, the status,
**     initially zero, has 1 added to it.
**
**  7) If the space velocity is a significant fraction of c (see the
**     constant VMAX), it is arbitrarily set to zero.  When this action
**     occurs, 2 is added to the status.
**
**  8) The relativistic adjustment involves an iterative calculation.
**     If the process fails to converge within a set number (IMAX) of
**     iterations, 4 is added to the status.
**
**  9) The inverse transformation is performed by the function
**     iauPvstar.
**
**  Called:
**     iauS2pv      spherical coordinates to pv-vector
**     iauPm        modulus of p-vector
**     iauZp        zero p-vector
**     iauPn        decompose p-vector into modulus and direction
**     iauPdp       scalar product of two p-vectors

**
**  1. The Software is owned by the IAU SOFA Board ("SOFA").
**
**  2. Permission is granted to anyone to use the SOFA software for any

**
**  3. You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others,
**     and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,
**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
**     with the following requirements:
**
**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
**        endorsed by SOFA.
**
**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
**        from the original SOFA software.
**
**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
**        thereof such as changes of case.
**
**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
**
**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
**        derived work.
**
**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
**     such, as explained above.
**
**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
**     by inappropriate modification.
**
**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the
**     SOFA software.  SOFA makes no warranties, express or implied, as

**     claim by any third party.
**
**  6. The provision of any version of the SOFA software under the terms
**     and conditions specified herein does not imply that future
**     versions will also be made available under the same terms and

**     note.
**
**  2) JD cannot unambiguously represent UTC during a leap second unless
**     special measures are taken.  The convention in the present
**     function is that the JD day represents UTC days whether the
**     length is 86399, 86400 or 86401 SI seconds.
**
**  3) The function iauD2dtf can be used to transform the UTC quasi-JD
**     into calendar date and clock time, including UTC leap second
**     handling.
**
**  4) The warning status "dubious year" flags UTCs that predate the
**     introduction of the time scale and that are too far in the future
**     to be trusted.  See iauDat for further details.

**
**  Status:  canonical.
**
**  Given:
**     tcb1,tcb2  double    TCB as a 2-part Julian Date

**
**  Returned (function value):
**                int       status:  0 = OK
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) tcb1+tcb2 is Julian Date, apportioned in any convenient way
**     between the two arguments, for example where tcb1 is the Julian
**     Day Number and tcb2 is the fraction of a day.  The returned
**     tdb1,tdb2 follow suit.
**
**  2) The 2006 IAU General Assembly introduced a conventional linear
**     transformation between TDB and TCB.  This transformation
**     compensates for the drift between TCB and terrestrial time TT,
**     and keeps TDB approximately centered on TT.  Because the
**     relationship between TT and TCB depends on the adopted solar
**     system ephemeris, the degree of alignment between TDB and TT over
**     long intervals will vary according to which ephemeris is used.
**     Former definitions of TDB attempted to avoid this problem by
**     stipulating that TDB and TT should differ only by periodic
**     effects.  This is a good description of the nature of the
**     relationship but eluded precise mathematical formulation.  The
**     conventional linear relationship adopted in 2006 sidestepped
**     these difficulties whilst delivering a TDB that in practice was
**     consistent with values before that date.
**
**  3) TDB is essentially the same as Teph, the time argument for the
**     JPL solar system ephemerides.

**  Time scale transformation:  Barycentric Dynamical Time, TDB, to
**  Terrestrial Time, TT.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  canonical.
**
**  Given:
**     tdb1,tdb2  double    TDB as a 2-part Julian Date
**     dtr        double    TDB-TT in seconds
**
**  Returned:
**     tt1,tt2    double    TT as a 2-part Julian Date
**
**  Returned (function value):
**                int       status:  0 = OK
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) tdb1+tdb2 is Julian Date, apportioned in any convenient way
**     between the two arguments, for example where tdb1 is the Julian
**     Day Number and tdb2 is the fraction of a day.  The returned
**     tt1,tt2 follow suit.
**
**  2) The argument dtr represents the quasi-periodic component of the
**     GR transformation between TT and TCB.  It is dependent upon the
**     adopted solar-system ephemeris, and can be obtained by numerical
**     integration, by interrogating a precomputed time ephemeris or by
**     evaluating a model such as that implemented in the SOFA function
**     iauDtdb.   The quantity is dominated by an annual term of 1.7 ms
**     amplitude.
**
**  3) TDB is essentially the same as Teph, the time argument for the
**     JPL solar system ephemerides.

**  Time scale transformation:  Terrestrial Time, TT, to Barycentric

**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  canonical.
**
**  Given:
**     tt1,tt2    double    TT as a 2-part Julian Date
**     dtr        double    TDB-TT in seconds
**
**  Returned:
**     tdb1,tdb2  double    TDB as a 2-part Julian Date
**
**  Returned (function value):
**                int       status:  0 = OK
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) tt1+tt2 is Julian Date, apportioned in any convenient way between
**     the two arguments, for example where tt1 is the Julian Day Number
**     and tt2 is the fraction of a day.  The returned tdb1,tdb2 follow
**     suit.
**
**  2) The argument dtr represents the quasi-periodic component of the
**     GR transformation between TT and TCB.  It is dependent upon the
**     adopted solar-system ephemeris, and can be obtained by numerical
**     integration, by interrogating a precomputed time ephemeris or by
**     evaluating a model such as that implemented in the SOFA function
**     iauDtdb.   The quantity is dominated by an annual term of 1.7 ms
**     amplitude.
**
**  3) TDB is essentially the same as Teph, the time argument for the JPL
**     solar system ephemerides.

**
**  Time scale transformation:  Universal Time, UT1, to Coordinated
**  Universal Time, UTC.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  canonical.
**
**  Given:
**     ut11,ut12  double   UT1 as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
**     dut1       double   Delta UT1: UT1-UTC in seconds (Note 2)
**
**  Returned:
**     utc1,utc2  double   UTC as a 2-part quasi Julian Date (Notes 3,4)
**
**  Returned (function value):
**                int      status: +1 = dubious year (Note 5)
**                                  0 = OK
**                                 -1 = unacceptable date
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) ut11+ut12 is Julian Date, apportioned in any convenient way
**     between the two arguments, for example where ut11 is the Julian
**     Day Number and ut12 is the fraction of a day.  The returned utc1
**     and utc2 form an analogous pair, except that a special convention
**     is used, to deal with the problem of leap seconds - see Note 3.
**
**  2) Delta UT1 can be obtained from tabulations provided by the
**     International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service.  The
**     value changes abruptly by 1s at a leap second;  however, close to
**     a leap second the algorithm used here is tolerant of the "wrong"
**     choice of value being made.
**
**  3) JD cannot unambiguously represent UTC during a leap second unless
**     special measures are taken.  The convention in the present
**     function is that the returned quasi JD day UTC1+UTC2 represents
**     UTC days whether the length is 86399, 86400 or 86401 SI seconds.
**
**  4) The function iauD2dtf can be used to transform the UTC quasi-JD
**     into calendar date and clock time, including UTC leap second
**     handling.
**
**  5) The warning status "dubious year" flags UTCs that predate the
**     introduction of the time scale and that are too far in the future
**     to be trusted.  See iauDat for further details.

**
**  X,Y coordinates of celestial intermediate pole from series based
**  on IAU 2006 precession and IAU 2000A nutation.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  canonical model.
**
**  Given:
**     date1,date2  double     TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
**
**  Returned:
**     x,y          double     CIP X,Y coordinates (Note 2)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
**     among others:
**
**            date1          date2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  2) The X,Y coordinates are those of the unit vector towards the
**     celestial intermediate pole.  They represent the combined effects
**     of frame bias, precession and nutation.
**
**  3) The fundamental arguments used are as adopted in IERS Conventions
**     (2003) and are from Simon et al. (1994) and Souchay et al.
**     (1999).
**
**  4) This is an alternative to the angles-based method, via the SOFA
**     function iauFw2xy and as used in iauXys06a for example.  The two
**     methods agree at the 1 microarcsecond level (at present), a
**     negligible amount compared with the intrinsic accuracy of the
**     models.  However, it would be unwise to mix the two methods
**     (angles-based and series-based) in a single application.

**
**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it

**
**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
**        from the original SOFA software.
**
**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not

**
**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must

**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
**
**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source

**
**  For a given TT date, compute the X,Y coordinates of the Celestial
**  Intermediate Pole and the CIO locator s, using the IAU 2000A
**  precession-nutation model.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  support function.
**
**  Given:
**     date1,date2  double   TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
**
**  Returned:
**     x,y          double   Celestial Intermediate Pole (Note 2)
**     s            double   the CIO locator s (Note 2)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
**     among others:
**
**            date1          date2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  2) The Celestial Intermediate Pole coordinates are the x,y
**     components of the unit vector in the Geocentric Celestial
**     Reference System.
**
**  3) The CIO locator s (in radians) positions the Celestial
**     Intermediate Origin on the equator of the CIP.
**
**  4) A faster, but slightly less accurate result (about 1 mas for
**     X,Y), can be obtained by using instead the iauXys00b function.

**  =====================
**
**  NOTICE TO USER:
**
**  BY USING THIS SOFTWARE YOU ACCEPT THE FOLLOWING SIX TERMS AND
**  CONDITIONS WHICH APPLY TO ITS USE.
**
**  1. The Software is owned by the IAU SOFA Board ("SOFA").
**
**  2. Permission is granted to anyone to use the SOFA software for any
**     purpose, including commercial applications, free of charge and
**     without payment of royalties, subject to the conditions and
**     restrictions listed below.
**
**  3. You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others,
**     and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,
**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
**     with the following requirements:
**
**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
**        endorsed by SOFA.
**
**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
**        from the original SOFA software.
**
**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
**        thereof such as changes of case.
**
**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
**
**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
**        derived work.
**
**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
**     such, as explained above.
**
**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
**     by inappropriate modification.
**
**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the
**     SOFA software.  SOFA makes no warranties, express or implied, as
**     to non-infringement of third party rights, merchantability, or
**     fitness for any particular purpose.  In no event will SOFA be
**     liable to the user for any consequential, incidental, or special
**     damages, including any lost profits or lost savings, even if a
**     SOFA representative has been advised of such damages, or for any
**     claim by any third party.
**
**  6. The provision of any version of the SOFA software under the terms
**     and conditions specified herein does not imply that future
**     versions will also be made available under the same terms and
**     conditions.
*
**  In any published work or commercial product which uses the SOFA
**  software directly, acknowledgement (see www.iausofa.org) is
**  appreciated.
