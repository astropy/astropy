*
* These routines are based on the wcsprm struct which contains all information
* needed for the computations.  The struct contains some members that must be
* set by the user, and others that are maintained by these routines, somewhat
* like a C++ class but with no encapsulation.
*
* wcsnpv(), wcsnps(), wcsini(), wcsinit(), wcssub(), wcsfree(), and wcstrim(),
* are provided to manage the wcsprm struct, wcssize() computes its total size
* including allocated memory, and wcsprt() prints its contents.  Refer to the
* description of the wcsprm struct for an explanation of the anticipated usage
* of these routines.  wcscopy(), which does a deep copy of one wcsprm struct
* to another, is defined as a preprocessor macro function that invokes
* wcssub().
*
* wcsperr() prints the error message(s) (if any) stored in a wcsprm struct,
* and the linprm, celprm, prjprm, spcprm, and tabprm structs that it contains.
*
* A setup routine, wcsset(), computes intermediate values in the wcsprm struct
* from parameters in it that were supplied by the user.  The struct always
* needs to be set up by wcsset() but this need not be called explicitly -
* refer to the explanation of wcsprm::flag.
*
* wcsp2s() and wcss2p() implement the WCS world coordinate transformations.
* In fact, they are high level driver routines for the WCS linear,
* logarithmic, celestial, spectral and tabular transformation routines
* described in lin.h, log.h, cel.h, spc.h and tab.h.
*
* Given either the celestial longitude or latitude plus an element of the
* pixel coordinate a hybrid routine, wcsmix(), iteratively solves for the
* unknown elements.
*
* wcsccs() changes the celestial coordinate system of a wcsprm struct, for
* example, from equatorial to galactic, and wcssptr() translates the spectral
* axis.  For example, a 'FREQ' axis may be translated into 'ZOPT-F2W' and vice
* versa.
*
* wcslib_version() returns the WCSLIB version number.
*
* Quadcube projections:
* ---------------------
*   The quadcube projections (TSC, CSC, QSC) may be represented in FITS in
*   either of two ways:
*
*     a: The six faces may be laid out in one plane and numbered as follows:
*
=                                 0
=
=                        4  3  2  1  4  3  2
=
=                                 5
*
*        Faces 2, 3 and 4 may appear on one side or the other (or both).  The
*        world-to-pixel routines map faces 2, 3 and 4 to the left but the
*        pixel-to-world routines accept them on either side.
*
*     b: The "COBE" convention in which the six faces are stored in a
*        three-dimensional structure using a CUBEFACE axis indexed from
*        0 to 5 as above.
*
*   These routines support both methods; wcsset() determines which is being
*   used by the presence or absence of a CUBEFACE axis in ctype[].  wcsp2s()
*   and wcss2p() translate the CUBEFACE axis representation to the single
*   plane representation understood by the lower-level WCSLIB projection
*   routines.
*
*
* wcsnpv() - Memory allocation for PVi_ma
* ---------------------------------------
* wcsnpv() sets or gets the value of NPVMAX (default 64).  This global
* variable controls the number of pvcard structs, for holding PVi_ma
* keyvalues, that wcsini() should allocate space for.  It is also used by
* wcsinit() as the default value of npvmax.
*
* PLEASE NOTE: This function is not thread-safe.
*
* Given:
*   n         int       Value of NPVMAX; ignored if < 0.  Use a value less
*                       than zero to get the current value.
*
* Function return value:
*             int       Current value of NPVMAX.
*
*
* wcsnps() - Memory allocation for PSi_ma
* ---------------------------------------
* wcsnps() sets or gets the value of NPSMAX (default 8).  This global variable
* controls the number of pscard structs, for holding PSi_ma keyvalues, that
* wcsini() should allocate space for.  It is also used by wcsinit() as the
* default value of npsmax.
*
* PLEASE NOTE: This function is not thread-safe.
*
* Given:
*   n         int       Value of NPSMAX; ignored if < 0.  Use a value less
*                       than zero to get the current value.
*
* Function return value:
*             int       Current value of NPSMAX.
*
*
* wcsini() - Default constructor for the wcsprm struct
* ----------------------------------------------------
* wcsini() is a thin wrapper on wcsinit().  It invokes it with npvmax,
* npsmax, and ndpmax set to -1 which causes it to use the values of the
* global variables NDPMAX, NPSMAX, and NDPMAX.  It is thereby potentially
* thread-unsafe if these variables are altered dynamically via wcsnpv(),
* wcsnps(), and disndp().  Use wcsinit() for a thread-safe alternative in
* this case.
*
*
* wcsinit() - Default constructor for the wcsprm struct
* -----------------------------------------------------
* wcsinit() optionally allocates memory for arrays in a wcsprm struct and sets
* all members of the struct to default values.
*
* PLEASE NOTE: every wcsprm struct should be initialized by wcsinit(),
* possibly repeatedly.  On the first invokation, and only the first
* invokation, wcsprm::flag must be set to -1 to initialize memory management,
* regardless of whether wcsinit() will actually be used to allocate memory.
*
* Given:
*   alloc     int       If true, allocate memory unconditionally for the
*                       crpix, etc. arrays.  Please note that memory is never
*                       allocated by wcsinit() for the auxprm, tabprm, nor
*                       wtbarr structs.
*
*                       If false, it is assumed that pointers to these arrays
*                       have been set by the user except if they are null
*                       pointers in which case memory will be allocated for
*                       them regardless.  (In other words, setting alloc true
*                       saves having to initalize these pointers to zero.)
*
*   naxis     int       The number of world coordinate axes.  This is used to
*                       determine the length of the various wcsprm vectors and
*                       matrices and therefore the amount of memory to
*                       allocate for them.
*
* Given and returned:
*   wcs       struct wcsprm*
*                       Coordinate transformation parameters.
*
*                       Note that, in order to initialize memory management,
*                       wcsprm::flag should be set to -1 when wcs is
*                       initialized for the first time (memory leaks may
*                       result if it had already been initialized).
*
* Given:
*   npvmax    int       The number of PVi_ma keywords to allocate space for.
*                       If set to -1, the value of the global variable NPVMAX
*                       will be used.  This is potentially thread-unsafe if
*                       wcsnpv() is being used dynamically to alter its value.
*
*   npsmax    int       The number of PSi_ma keywords to allocate space for.
*                       If set to -1, the value of the global variable NPSMAX
*                       will be used.  This is potentially thread-unsafe if
*                       wcsnps() is being used dynamically to alter its value.
*
*   ndpmax    int       The number of DPja or DQia keywords to allocate space
*                       for.  If set to -1, the value of the global variable
*                       NDPMAX will be used.  This is potentially
*                       thread-unsafe if disndp() is being used dynamically to
*                       alter its value.
*
* Function return value:
*             int       Status return value:
*                         0: Success.
*                         1: Null wcsprm pointer passed.
*                         2: Memory allocation failed.
*
*                       For returns > 1, a detailed error message is set in
*                       wcsprm::err if enabled, see wcserr_enable().
*
*
* wcsauxi() - Default constructor for the auxprm struct
* -----------------------------------------------------
* wcsauxi() optionally allocates memory for an auxprm struct, attaches it to
* wcsprm, and sets all members of the struct to default values.
*
* Given:
*   alloc     int       If true, allocate memory unconditionally for the
*                       auxprm struct.
*
*                       If false, it is assumed that wcsprm::aux has already
*                       been set to point to an auxprm struct, in which case
*                       the user is responsible for managing that memory.
*                       However, if wcsprm::aux is a null pointer, memory will
*                       be allocated regardless.  (In other words, setting
*                       alloc true saves having to initalize the pointer to
*                       zero.)
*
* Given and returned:
*   wcs       struct wcsprm*
*                       Coordinate transformation parameters.
*
* Function return value:
*             int       Status return value:
*                         0: Success.
*                         1: Null wcsprm pointer passed.
*                         2: Memory allocation failed.
*
*
* wcssub() - Subimage extraction routine for the wcsprm struct
* ------------------------------------------------------------
* wcssub() extracts the coordinate description for a subimage from a wcsprm
* struct.  It does a deep copy, using wcsinit() to allocate memory for its
* arrays if required.  Only the "information to be provided" part of the
* struct is extracted.  Consequently, wcsset() need not have been, and won't
* be invoked on the struct from which the subimage is extracted.  A call to
* wcsset() is required to set up the subimage struct.
*
* The world coordinate system of the subimage must be separable in the sense
* that the world coordinates at any point in the subimage must depend only on
* the pixel coordinates of the axes extracted.  In practice, this means that
* the linear transformation matrix of the original image must not contain
* non-zero off-diagonal terms that associate any of the subimage axes with any
* of the non-subimage axes.  Likewise, if any distortions are associated with
* the subimage axes, they must not depend on any of the axes that are not
* being extracted.
*
* Note that while the required elements of the tabprm array are extracted, the
* wtbarr array is not.  (Thus it is not appropriate to call wcssub() after
* wcstab() but before filling the tabprm structs - refer to wcshdr.h.)
*
* wcssub() can also add axes to a wcsprm struct.  The new axes will be created
* using the defaults set by wcsinit() which produce a simple, unnamed, linear
* axis with world coordinate equal to the pixel coordinate.  These default
* values can be changed afterwards, before invoking wcsset().
*
* Given:
*   alloc     int       If true, allocate memory for the crpix, etc. arrays in
*                       the destination.  Otherwise, it is assumed that
*                       pointers to these arrays have been set by the user
*                       except if they are null pointers in which case memory
*                       will be allocated for them regardless.
*
*   wcssrc    const struct wcsprm*
*                       Struct to extract from.
*
* Given and returned:
*   nsub      int*
*   axes      int[]     Vector of length *nsub containing the image axis
*                       numbers (1-relative) to extract.  Order is
*                       significant; axes[0] is the axis number of the input
*                       image that corresponds to the first axis in the
*                       subimage, etc.
*
*                       Use an axis number of 0 to create a new axis using
*                       the defaults set by wcsinit().  They can be changed
*                       later.
*
*                       nsub (the pointer) may be set to zero, and so also may
*                       *nsub, which is interpreted to mean all axes in the
*                       input image; the number of axes will be returned if
*                       nsub != 0x0.  axes itself (the pointer) may be set to
*                       zero to indicate the first *nsub axes in their
*                       original order.
*
*                       Set both nsub (or *nsub) and axes to zero to do a deep
*                       copy of one wcsprm struct to another.
*
*                       Subimage extraction by coordinate axis type may be
*                       done by setting the elements of axes[] to the
*                       following special preprocessor macro values:
*
*                         WCSSUB_LONGITUDE: Celestial longitude.
*                         WCSSUB_LATITUDE:  Celestial latitude.
*                         WCSSUB_CUBEFACE:  Quadcube CUBEFACE axis.
*                         WCSSUB_SPECTRAL:  Spectral axis.
*                         WCSSUB_STOKES:    Stokes axis.
*                         WCSSUB_TIME:      Time axis.
*
*                       Refer to the notes (below) for further usage examples.
*
*                       On return, *nsub will be set to the number of axes in
*                       the subimage; this may be zero if there were no axes
*                       of the required type(s) (in which case no memory will
*                       be allocated).  axes[] will contain the axis numbers
*                       that were extracted, or 0 for newly created axes.  The
*                       vector length must be sufficient to contain all axis
*                       numbers.  No checks are performed to verify that the
*                       coordinate axes are consistent, this is done by
*                       wcsset().
*
*   wcsdst    struct wcsprm*
*                       Struct describing the subimage.  wcsprm::flag should
*                       be set to -1 if wcsdst was not previously initialized
*                       (memory leaks may result if it was previously
*                       initialized).
*
* Function return value:
*             int       Status return value:
*                         0: Success.
*                         1: Null wcsprm pointer passed.
*                         2: Memory allocation failed.
*                        12: Invalid subimage specification.
*                        13: Non-separable subimage coordinate system.
*
*                       For returns > 1, a detailed error message is set in
*                       wcsprm::err if enabled, see wcserr_enable().
*
* Notes:
*   1: Combinations of subimage axes of particular types may be extracted in
*      the same order as they occur in the input image by combining
*      preprocessor codes, for example
*
=        *nsub = 1;
=        axes[0] = WCSSUB_LONGITUDE | WCSSUB_LATITUDE | WCSSUB_SPECTRAL;
*
*      would extract the longitude, latitude, and spectral axes in the same
*      order as the input image.  If one of each were present, *nsub = 3 would
*      be returned.
*
*      For convenience, WCSSUB_CELESTIAL is defined as the combination
*      WCSSUB_LONGITUDE | WCSSUB_LATITUDE | WCSSUB_CUBEFACE.
*
*      The codes may also be negated to extract all but the types specified,
*      for example
*
=        *nsub = 4;
=        axes[0] = WCSSUB_LONGITUDE;
=        axes[1] = WCSSUB_LATITUDE;
=        axes[2] = WCSSUB_CUBEFACE;
=        axes[3] = -(WCSSUB_SPECTRAL | WCSSUB_STOKES);
*
*      The last of these specifies all axis types other than spectral or
*      Stokes.  Extraction is done in the order specified by axes[] a
*      longitude axis (if present) would be extracted first (via axes[0]) and
*      not subsequently (via axes[3]).  Likewise for the latitude and cubeface
*      axes in this example.
*
*      From the foregoing, it is apparent that the value of *nsub returned may
*      be less than or greater than that given.  However, it will never exceed
*      the number of axes in the input image (plus the number of newly-created
*      axes if any were specified on input).
*
*
* wcscompare() - Compare two wcsprm structs for equality
* ------------------------------------------------------
* wcscompare() compares two wcsprm structs for equality.
*
* Given:
*   cmp       int       A bit field controlling the strictness of the
*                       comparison.  When 0, all fields must be identical.
*
*                       The following constants may be or'ed together to
*                       relax the comparison:
*                         WCSCOMPARE_ANCILLARY: Ignore ancillary keywords
*                           that don't change the WCS transformation, such
*                           as DATE-OBS or EQUINOX.
*                         WCSCOMPARE_TILING: Ignore integral differences in
*                           CRPIXja.  This is the 'tiling' condition, where
*                           two WCSes cover different regions of the same
*                           map projection and align on the same map grid.
*                         WCSCOMPARE_CRPIX: Ignore any differences at all in
*                           CRPIXja.  The two WCSes cover different regions
*                           of the same map projection but may not align on
*                           the same map grid.  Overrides WCSCOMPARE_TILING.
*
*   tol       double    Tolerance for comparison of floating-point values.
*                       For example, for tol == 1e-6, all floating-point
*                       values in the structs must be equal to the first 6
*                       decimal places.  A value of 0 implies exact equality.
*
*   wcs1      const struct wcsprm*
*                       The first wcsprm struct to compare.
*
*   wcs2      const struct wcsprm*
*                       The second wcsprm struct to compare.
*
* Returned:
*   equal     int*      Non-zero when the given structs are equal.
*
* Function return value:
*             int       Status return value:
*                         0: Success.
*                         1: Null pointer passed.
*
*
* wcscopy() macro - Copy routine for the wcsprm struct
* ----------------------------------------------------
* wcscopy() does a deep copy of one wcsprm struct to another.  As of
* WCSLIB 3.6, it is implemented as a preprocessor macro that invokes
* wcssub() with the nsub and axes pointers both set to zero.
*
*
* wcsfree() - Destructor for the wcsprm struct
* --------------------------------------------
* wcsfree() frees memory allocated for the wcsprm arrays by wcsinit() and/or
* wcsset().  wcsinit() records the memory it allocates and wcsfree() will only
* attempt to free this.
*
* PLEASE NOTE: wcsfree() must not be invoked on a wcsprm struct that was not
* initialized by wcsinit().
*
* Given and returned:
*   wcs       struct wcsprm*
*                       Coordinate transformation parameters.
*
* Function return value:
*             int       Status return value:
*                         0: Success.
*                         1: Null wcsprm pointer passed.
*
*
* wcstrim() - Free unused arrays in the wcsprm struct
* ---------------------------------------------------
* wcstrim() frees memory allocated by wcsinit() for arrays in the wcsprm
* struct that remains unused after it has been set up by wcsset().
*
* The free'd array members are associated with FITS WCS keyrecords that are
* rarely used and usually just bloat the struct: wcsprm::crota, wcsprm::colax,
* wcsprm::cname, wcsprm::crder, wcsprm::csyer, wcsprm::czphs, and
* wcsprm::cperi.  If unused, wcsprm::pv, wcsprm::ps, and wcsprm::cd are also
* freed.
*
* Once these arrays have been freed, a test such as
=
=        if (!undefined(wcs->cname[i])) {...}
=
* must be protected as follows
=
=        if (wcs->cname && !undefined(wcs->cname[i])) {...}
=
* In addition, if wcsprm::npv is non-zero but less than wcsprm::npvmax, then
* the unused space in wcsprm::pv will be recovered (using realloc()).
* Likewise for wcsprm::ps.
*
* Given and returned:
*   wcs       struct wcsprm*
*                       Coordinate transformation parameters.
*
* Function return value:
*             int       Status return value:
*                         0: Success.
*                         1: Null wcsprm pointer passed.
*                        14: wcsprm struct is unset.
*
*
* wcssize() - Compute the size of a wcsprm struct
* -----------------------------------------------
* wcssize() computes the full size of a wcsprm struct, including allocated
* memory.
*
* Given:
*   wcs       const struct wcsprm*
*                       Coordinate transformation parameters.
*
*                       If NULL, the base size of the struct and the allocated
*                       size are both set to zero.
*
* Returned:
*   sizes     int[2]    The first element is the base size of the struct as
*                       returned by sizeof(struct wcsprm).  The second element
*                       is the total allocated size, in bytes, assuming that
*                       the allocation was done by wcsini().  This figure
*                       includes memory allocated for members of constituent
*                       structs, such as wcsprm::lin.
*
*                       It is not an error for the struct not to have been set
*                       up via wcsset(), which normally results in additional
*                       memory allocation. 
*
* Function return value:
*             int       Status return value:
*                         0: Success.
*
*
* auxsize() - Compute the size of a auxprm struct
* -----------------------------------------------
* auxsize() computes the full size of a auxprm struct, including allocated
* memory.
*
* Given:
*   aux       const struct auxprm*
*                       Auxiliary coordinate information.
*
*                       If NULL, the base size of the struct and the allocated
*                       size are both set to zero.
*
* Returned:
*   sizes     int[2]    The first element is the base size of the struct as
*                       returned by sizeof(struct auxprm).  The second element
*                       is the total allocated size, in bytes, currently zero.
*
* Function return value:
*             int       Status return value:
*                         0: Success.
*
*
* wcsprt() - Print routine for the wcsprm struct
* ----------------------------------------------
* wcsprt() prints the contents of a wcsprm struct using wcsprintf().  Mainly
* intended for diagnostic purposes.
*
* Given:
*   wcs       const struct wcsprm*
*                       Coordinate transformation parameters.
*
* Function return value:
*             int       Status return value:
*                         0: Success.
*                         1: Null wcsprm pointer passed.
*
*
* wcsperr() - Print error messages from a wcsprm struct
* -----------------------------------------------------
* wcsperr() prints the error message(s), if any, stored in a wcsprm struct,
* and the linprm, celprm, prjprm, spcprm, and tabprm structs that it contains.
* If there are no errors then nothing is printed.  It uses wcserr_prt(), q.v.
*
* Given:
*   wcs       const struct wcsprm*
*                       Coordinate transformation parameters.
*
*   prefix    const char *
*                       If non-NULL, each output line will be prefixed with
*                       this string.
*
* Function return value:
*             int       Status return value:
*                         0: Success.
*                         1: Null wcsprm pointer passed.
*
*
* wcsbchk() - Enable/disable bounds checking
* ------------------------------------------
* wcsbchk() is used to control bounds checking in the projection routines.
* Note that wcsset() always enables bounds checking.  wcsbchk() will invoke
* wcsset() on the wcsprm struct beforehand if necessary.
*
* Given and returned:
*   wcs       struct wcsprm*
*                       Coordinate transformation parameters.
*
* Given:
*   bounds    int       If bounds&1 then enable strict bounds checking for the
*                       spherical-to-Cartesian (s2x) transformation for the
*                       AZP, SZP, TAN, SIN, ZPN, and COP projections.
*
*                       If bounds&2 then enable strict bounds checking for the
*                       Cartesian-to-spherical (x2s) transformation for the
*                       HPX and XPH projections.
*
*                       If bounds&4 then enable bounds checking on the native
*                       coordinates returned by the Cartesian-to-spherical
*                       (x2s) transformations using prjchk().
*
*                       Zero it to disable all checking.
*
* Function return value:
*             int       Status return value:
*                         0: Success.
*                         1: Null wcsprm pointer passed.
*
*
* wcsset() - Setup routine for the wcsprm struct
* ----------------------------------------------
* wcsset() sets up a wcsprm struct according to information supplied within
* it (refer to the description of the wcsprm struct).
*
* wcsset() recognizes the NCP projection and converts it to the equivalent SIN
* projection and likewise translates GLS into SFL.  It also translates the
* AIPS spectral types ('FREQ-LSR', 'FELO-HEL', etc.), possibly changing the
* input header keywords wcsprm::ctype and/or wcsprm::specsys if necessary.
*
* Note that this routine need not be called directly; it will be invoked by
* wcsp2s() and wcss2p() if the wcsprm::flag is anything other than a
* predefined magic value.
*
* Given and returned:
*   wcs       struct wcsprm*
*                       Coordinate transformation parameters.
*
* Function return value:
*             int       Status return value:
*                         0: Success.
*                         1: Null wcsprm pointer passed.
*                         2: Memory allocation failed.
*                         3: Linear transformation matrix is singular.
*                         4: Inconsistent or unrecognized coordinate axis
*                            types.

*                         6: Invalid coordinate transformation parameters.
*                         7: Ill-conditioned coordinate transformation
*                            parameters.
*
*                       For returns > 1, a detailed error message is set in
*                       wcsprm::err if enabled, see wcserr_enable().
*
* Notes:
*   1: wcsset() always enables strict bounds checking in the projection
*      routines (via a call to prjini()).  Use wcsbchk() to modify
*      bounds-checking after wcsset() is invoked.
*
*
* wcsp2s() - Pixel-to-world transformation
* ----------------------------------------
* wcsp2s() transforms pixel coordinates to world coordinates.

*                       Longitude ranges may be specified with any convenient
*                       normalization, for example [-120,+120] is the same as
*                       [240,480], except that the solution will be returned
*                       with the same normalization, i.e. lie within the
*                       interval specified.
*
*   vstep     const double

*
*   viter     int       If a solution is not found then the step size will be

*                       many times the step size is halved.  The allowed range
*                       is 5 - 10.
*
* Given and returned:

*                       latitude [deg].  Which is given and which returned
*                       depends on the value of mixcel.  All other elements
*                       are given.

*                        11: No solution found in the specified interval.
*
*                       For returns > 1, a detailed error message is set in
*                       wcsprm::err if enabled, see wcserr_enable().
*
* Notes:
*   1: Initially the specified solution interval is checked to see if it's a
*      "crossing" interval.  If it isn't, a search is made for a crossing
*      solution by iterating on the unknown celestial coordinate starting at
*      the upper limit of the solution interval and decrementing by the
*      specified step size.  A crossing is indicated if the trial value of the
*      pixel coordinate steps through the value specified.  If a crossing
*      interval is found then the solution is determined by a modified form of
*      "regula falsi" division of the crossing interval.  If no crossing
*      interval was found within the specified solution interval then a search
*      is made for a "non-crossing" solution as may arise from a point of
*      tangency.  The process is complicated by having to make allowance for
*      the discontinuities that occur in all map projections.
*
*      Once one solution has been determined others may be found by subsequent
*      invokations of wcsmix() with suitably restricted solution intervals.
*
*      Note the circumstance that arises when the solution point lies at a
*      native pole of a projection in which the pole is represented as a
*      finite curve, for example the zenithals and conics.  In such cases two
*      or more valid solutions may exist but wcsmix() only ever returns one.
*
*      Because of its generality wcsmix() is very compute-intensive.  For
*      compute-limited applications more efficient special-case solvers could
*      be written for simple projections, for example non-oblique cylindrical
*      projections.
*
*
* wcsccs() - Change celestial coordinate system
* ---------------------------------------------
* wcsccs() changes the celestial coordinate system of a wcsprm struct.  For
* example, from equatorial to galactic coordinates.
*
* Parameters that define the spherical coordinate transformation, essentially
* being three Euler angles, must be provided.  Thereby wcsccs() does not need
* prior knowledge of specific celestial coordinate systems.  It also has the
* advantage of making it completely general.
*
* Auxiliary members of the wcsprm struct relating to equatorial celestial
* coordinate systems may also be changed.
*
* Only orthodox spherical coordinate systems are supported.  That is, they
* must be right-handed, with latitude increasing from zero at the equator to
* +90 degrees at the pole.  This precludes systems such as aziumuth and zenith
* distance, which, however, could be handled as negative azimuth and
* elevation.
*
* PLEASE NOTE: Information in the wcsprm struct relating to the original
* coordinate system will be overwritten and therefore lost.  If this is
* undesirable, invoke wcsccs() on a copy of the struct made with wcssub().
* The wcsprm struct is reset on return with an explicit call to wcsset().
*
* Given and returned:
*   wcs       struct wcsprm*
*                       Coordinate transformation parameters.  Particular
*                       "values to be given" elements of the wcsprm struct
*                       are modified.
*
* Given:
*   lng2p1,
*   lat2p1    double    Longitude and latitude in the new celestial coordinate
*                       system of the pole (i.e. latitude +90) of the original
*                       system [deg].  See notes 1 and 2 below.
*
*   lng1p2    double    Longitude in the original celestial coordinate system
*                       of the pole (i.e. latitude +90) of the new system

*                       celestial axis codes, without trailing dashes.  For
*                       example, "RA" and "DEC" or "GLON" and "GLAT".  Up to
*                       four characters are used, longer strings need not be
*                       null-terminated.
*
*   radesys   const char*
*                       Used when transforming to equatorial coordinates,
*                       identified by clng == "RA" and clat = "DEC".  May be
*                       set to the null pointer to preserve the current value.
*                       Up to 71 characters are used, longer strings need not
*                       be null-terminated.
*
*                       If the new coordinate system is anything other than
*                       equatorial, then wcsprm::radesys will be cleared.
*
*   equinox   double    Used when transforming to equatorial coordinates.  May
*                       be set to zero to preserve the current value.
*
*                       If the new coordinate system is not equatorial, then
*                       wcsprm::equinox will be marked as undefined.
*
*   alt       const char*
*                       Character code for alternate coordinate descriptions
*                       (i.e. the 'a' in keyword names such as CTYPEia).  This
*                       is blank for the primary coordinate description, or
*                       one of the 26 upper-case letters, A-Z.  May be set to
*                       the null pointer, or null string if no change is
*                       required.
*
* Function return value:
*             int       Status return value:
*                         0: Success.
*                         1: Null wcsprm pointer passed.
*                        12: Invalid subimage specification (no celestial
*                            axes).
*
* Notes:
*   1: Follows the prescription given in WCS Paper II, Sect. 2.7 for changing
*      celestial coordinates.
*
*      The implementation takes account of indeterminacies that arise in that
*      prescription in the particular cases where one of the poles of the new
*      system is at the fiducial point, or one of them is at the native pole.
*
*   2: If lat2p1 == +90, i.e. where the poles of the two coordinate systems
*      coincide, then the spherical coordinate transformation becomes a simple
*      change in origin of longitude given by
*      lng2 = lng1 + (lng2p1 - lng1p2 - 180), and lat2 = lat1, where
*      (lng2,lat2) are coordinates in the new system, and (lng1,lat1) are
*      coordinates in the original system.
*
*      Likewise, if lat2p1 == -90, then lng2 = -lng1 + (lng2p1 + lng1p2), and
*      lat2 = -lat1.
*
*   3: For example, if the original coordinate system is B1950 equatorial and
*      the desired new coordinate system is galactic, then
*
*      - (lng2p1,lat2p1) are the galactic coordinates of the B1950 celestial
*        pole, defined by the IAU to be (123.0,+27.4), and lng1p2 is the B1950
*        right ascension of the galactic pole, defined as 192.25.  Clearly
*        these coordinates are fixed for a particular coordinate
*        transformation.
*
*      - (clng,clat) would be 'GLON' and 'GLAT', these being the FITS standard
*        identifiers for galactic coordinates.
*
*      - Since the new coordinate system is not equatorial, wcsprm::radesys
*        and wcsprm::equinox will be cleared.
*
*   4. The coordinates required for some common transformations (obtained from
*      https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/coordinate_calculator) are as follows:
*
=      (123.0000,+27.4000) galactic coordinates of B1950 celestial pole,
=      (192.2500,+27.4000) B1950 equatorial coordinates of galactic pole.
*
=      (122.9319,+27.1283) galactic coordinates of J2000 celestial pole,
=      (192.8595,+27.1283) J2000 equatorial coordinates of galactic pole.
*
=      (359.6774,+89.7217) B1950 equatorial coordinates of J2000 pole,
=      (180.3162,+89.7217) J2000 equatorial coordinates of B1950 pole.
*
=      (270.0000,+66.5542) B1950 equatorial coordinates of B1950 ecliptic pole,
=      ( 90.0000,+66.5542) B1950 ecliptic coordinates of B1950 celestial pole.
*
=      (270.0000,+66.5607) J2000 equatorial coordinates of J2000 ecliptic pole,
=      ( 90.0000,+66.5607) J2000 ecliptic coordinates of J2000 celestial pole.
*
=      ( 26.7315,+15.6441) supergalactic coordinates of B1950 celestial pole,
=      (283.1894,+15.6441) B1950 equatorial coordinates of supergalactic pole.
*
=      ( 26.4505,+15.7089) supergalactic coordinates of J2000 celestial pole,
=      (283.7542,+15.7089) J2000 equatorial coordinates of supergalactic pole.

*
* wcssptr() - Spectral axis translation
* -------------------------------------
* wcssptr() translates the spectral axis in a wcsprm struct.  For example, a
* 'FREQ' axis may be translated into 'ZOPT-F2W' and vice versa.
*
* PLEASE NOTE: Information in the wcsprm struct relating to the original
* coordinate system will be overwritten and therefore lost.  If this is
* undesirable, invoke wcssptr() on a copy of the struct made with wcssub().
* The wcsprm struct is reset on return with an explicit call to wcsset().
*
* Given and returned:
*   wcs       struct wcsprm*
*                       Coordinate transformation parameters.
*
*   i         int*      Index of the spectral axis (0-relative).  If given < 0
*                       it will be set to the first spectral axis identified
*                       from the ctype[] keyvalues in the wcsprm struct.

*                       the prologue of spc.h, i.e. if the final three
*                       characters are specified as "???", or if just the
*                       eighth character is specified as '?', the correct
*                       algorithm code will be substituted and returned.
*
* Function return value:

*                       For returns > 1, a detailed error message is set in

*
*
* wcslib_version() - WCSLIB version number
* ----------------------------------------
* wcslib_version() returns the WCSLIB version number.
*
* The major version number changes when the ABI changes or when the license
* conditions change.  ABI changes typically result from a change to the
* contents of one of the structs.  The major version number is used to
* distinguish between incompatible versions of the sharable library.
*
* The minor version number changes with new functionality or bug fixes that do
* not involve a change in the ABI.
*
* The auxiliary version number (which is often absent) signals changes to the
* documentation, test suite, build procedures, or any other change that does
* not affect the compiled library.
*
* Returned:
*   vers[3]   int[3]    The broken-down version number:
*                         0: Major version number.
*                         1: Minor version number.
*                         2: Auxiliary version number (zero if absent).
*                       May be given as a null pointer if not required.
*
* Function return value:
*             char*     A null-terminated, statically allocated string
*                       containing the version number in the usual form, i.e.
*                       "<major>.<minor>.<auxiliary>".
*
*
* wcsprm struct - Coordinate transformation parameters
* ----------------------------------------------------
* The wcsprm struct contains information required to transform world
* coordinates.  It consists of certain members that must be set by the user
* ("given") and others that are set by the WCSLIB routines ("returned").
* While the addresses of the arrays themselves may be set by wcsinit() if it
* (optionally) allocates memory, their contents must be set by the user.
*
* Some parameters that are given are not actually required for transforming
* coordinates.  These are described as "auxiliary"; the struct simply provides
* a place to store them, though they may be used by wcshdo() in constructing a
* FITS header from a wcsprm struct.  Some of the returned values are supplied
* for informational purposes and others are for internal use only as
* indicated.
*
* In practice, it is expected that a WCS parser would scan the FITS header to
* determine the number of coordinate axes.  It would then use wcsinit() to
* allocate memory for arrays in the wcsprm struct and set default values.
* Then as it reread the header and identified each WCS keyrecord it would load
* the value into the relevant wcsprm array element.  This is essentially what
* wcspih() does - refer to the prologue of wcshdr.h.  As the final step,
* wcsset() is invoked, either directly or indirectly, to set the derived
* members of the wcsprm struct.  wcsset() strips off trailing blanks in all
* string members and null-fills the character array.
*
*   int flag
*     (Given and returned) This flag must be set to zero whenever any of the
*     following wcsprm struct members are set or changed:
*
*       - wcsprm::naxis (q.v., not normally set by the user),
*       - wcsprm::crpix,
*       - wcsprm::pc,
*       - wcsprm::cdelt,
*       - wcsprm::crval,
*       - wcsprm::cunit,
*       - wcsprm::ctype,
*       - wcsprm::lonpole,
*       - wcsprm::latpole,
*       - wcsprm::restfrq,
*       - wcsprm::restwav,
*       - wcsprm::npv,
*       - wcsprm::pv,
*       - wcsprm::nps,
*       - wcsprm::ps,
*       - wcsprm::cd,
*       - wcsprm::crota,
*       - wcsprm::altlin,
*       - wcsprm::ntab,
*       - wcsprm::nwtb,
*       - wcsprm::tab,
*       - wcsprm::wtb.
*
*     This signals the initialization routine, wcsset(), to recompute the
*     returned members of the linprm, celprm, spcprm, and tabprm structs.
*     wcsset() will reset flag to indicate that this has been done.
*
*     PLEASE NOTE: flag should be set to -1 when wcsinit() is called for the
*     first time for a particular wcsprm struct in order to initialize memory
*     management.  It must ONLY be used on the first initialization otherwise
*     memory leaks may result.
*
*   int naxis
*     (Given or returned) Number of pixel and world coordinate elements.
*
*     If wcsinit() is used to initialize the linprm struct (as would normally
*     be the case) then it will set naxis from the value passed to it as a
*     function argument.  The user should not subsequently modify it.
*
*   double *crpix
*     (Given) Address of the first element of an array of double containing
*     the coordinate reference pixel, CRPIXja.
*
*   double *pc
*     (Given) Address of the first element of the PCi_ja (pixel coordinate)
*     transformation matrix.  The expected order is
*
=       struct wcsprm wcs;
=       wcs.pc = {PC1_1, PC1_2, PC2_1, PC2_2};
*
*     This may be constructed conveniently from a 2-D array via
*
=       double m[2][2] = {{PC1_1, PC1_2},
=                         {PC2_1, PC2_2}};
*
*     which is equivalent to
*
=       double m[2][2];
=       m[0][0] = PC1_1;
=       m[0][1] = PC1_2;
=       m[1][0] = PC2_1;
=       m[1][1] = PC2_2;
*
*     The storage order for this 2-D array is the same as for the 1-D array,
*     whence
*
=       wcs.pc = *m;
*
*     would be legitimate.
*
*   double *cdelt
*     (Given) Address of the first element of an array of double containing
*     the coordinate increments, CDELTia.
*
*   double *crval
*     (Given) Address of the first element of an array of double containing
*     the coordinate reference values, CRVALia.
*
*   char (*cunit)[72]
*     (Given) Address of the first element of an array of char[72] containing
*     the CUNITia keyvalues which define the units of measurement of the
*     CRVALia, CDELTia, and CDi_ja keywords.
*
*     As CUNITia is an optional header keyword, cunit[][72] may be left blank
*     but otherwise is expected to contain a standard units specification as
*     defined by WCS Paper I.  Utility function wcsutrn(), described in
*     wcsunits.h, is available to translate commonly used non-standard units
*     specifications but this must be done as a separate step before invoking
*     wcsset().
*
*     For celestial axes, if cunit[][72] is not blank, wcsset() uses
*     wcsunits() to parse it and scale cdelt[], crval[], and cd[][*] to
*     degrees.  It then resets cunit[][72] to "deg".
*
*     For spectral axes, if cunit[][72] is not blank, wcsset() uses wcsunits()
*     to parse it and scale cdelt[], crval[], and cd[][*] to SI units.  It
*     then resets cunit[][72] accordingly.
*
*     wcsset() ignores cunit[][72] for other coordinate types; cunit[][72] may
*     be used to label coordinate values.
*
*     These variables accomodate the longest allowed string-valued FITS
*     keyword, being limited to 68 characters, plus the null-terminating
*     character.
*
*   char (*ctype)[72]
*     (Given) Address of the first element of an array of char[72] containing
*     the coordinate axis types, CTYPEia.
*
*     The ctype[][72] keyword values must be in upper case and there must be
*     zero or one pair of matched celestial axis types, and zero or one
*     spectral axis.  The ctype[][72] strings should be padded with blanks on
*     the right and null-terminated so that they are at least eight characters
*     in length.
*
*     These variables accomodate the longest allowed string-valued FITS
*     keyword, being limited to 68 characters, plus the null-terminating
*     character.
*
*   double lonpole
*     (Given and returned) The native longitude of the celestial pole, phi_p,
*     given by LONPOLEa [deg] or by PVi_2a [deg] attached to the longitude
*     axis which takes precedence if defined, and ...
*   double latpole
*     (Given and returned) ... the native latitude of the celestial pole,
*     theta_p, given by LATPOLEa [deg] or by PVi_3a [deg] attached to the
*     longitude axis which takes precedence if defined.
*
*     lonpole and latpole may be left to default to values set by wcsinit()
*     (see celprm::ref), but in any case they will be reset by wcsset() to
*     the values actually used.  Note therefore that if the wcsprm struct is
*     reused without resetting them, whether directly or via wcsinit(), they
*     will no longer have their default values.
*
*   double restfrq
*     (Given) The rest frequency [Hz], and/or ...
*   double restwav
*     (Given) ... the rest wavelength in vacuo [m], only one of which need be
*     given, the other should be set to zero.
*
*   int npv
*     (Given) The number of entries in the wcsprm::pv[] array.
*
*   int npvmax
*     (Given or returned) The length of the wcsprm::pv[] array.
*
*     npvmax will be set by wcsinit() if it allocates memory for wcsprm::pv[],
*     otherwise it must be set by the user.  See also wcsnpv().
*
*   struct pvcard *pv
*     (Given) Address of the first element of an array of length npvmax of
*     pvcard structs.
*
*     As a FITS header parser encounters each PVi_ma keyword it should load it
*     into a pvcard struct in the array and increment npv.  wcsset()
*     interprets these as required.
*
*     Note that, if they were not given, wcsset() resets the entries for
*     PVi_1a, PVi_2a, PVi_3a, and PVi_4a for longitude axis i to match
*     phi_0 and theta_0 (the native longitude and latitude of the reference
*     point), LONPOLEa and LATPOLEa respectively.
*
*   int nps
*     (Given) The number of entries in the wcsprm::ps[] array.
*
*   int npsmax
*     (Given or returned) The length of the wcsprm::ps[] array.
*
*     npsmax will be set by wcsinit() if it allocates memory for wcsprm::ps[],
*     otherwise it must be set by the user.  See also wcsnps().
*
*   struct pscard *ps
*     (Given) Address of the first element of an array of length npsmax of
*     pscard structs.
*
*     As a FITS header parser encounters each PSi_ma keyword it should load it
*     into a pscard struct in the array and increment nps.  wcsset()
*     interprets these as required (currently no PSi_ma keyvalues are
*     recognized).
*
*   double *cd
*     (Given) For historical compatibility, the wcsprm struct supports two
*     alternate specifications of the linear transformation matrix, those
*     associated with the CDi_ja keywords, and ...
*   double *crota
*     (Given) ... those associated with the CROTAi keywords.  Although these
*     may not formally co-exist with PCi_ja, the approach taken here is simply
*     to ignore them if given in conjunction with PCi_ja.
*
*   int altlin
*     (Given) altlin is a bit flag that denotes which of the PCi_ja, CDi_ja
*     and CROTAi keywords are present in the header:
*
*     - Bit 0: PCi_ja is present.
*
*     - Bit 1: CDi_ja is present.
*
*       Matrix elements in the IRAF convention are equivalent to the product
*       CDi_ja = CDELTia * PCi_ja, but the defaults differ from that of the
*       PCi_ja matrix.  If one or more CDi_ja keywords are present then all
*       unspecified CDi_ja default to zero.  If no CDi_ja (or CROTAi) keywords
*       are present, then the header is assumed to be in PCi_ja form whether
*       or not any PCi_ja keywords are present since this results in an
*       interpretation of CDELTia consistent with the original FITS
*       specification.
*
*       While CDi_ja may not formally co-exist with PCi_ja, it may co-exist
*       with CDELTia and CROTAi which are to be ignored.
*
*     - Bit 2: CROTAi is present.
*
*       In the AIPS convention, CROTAi may only be associated with the
*       latitude axis of a celestial axis pair.  It specifies a rotation in
*       the image plane that is applied AFTER the CDELTia; any other CROTAi
*       keywords are ignored.
*
*       CROTAi may not formally co-exist with PCi_ja.
*
*       CROTAi and CDELTia may formally co-exist with CDi_ja but if so are to
*       be ignored.
*
*     - Bit 3: PCi_ja + CDELTia was derived from CDi_ja by wcspcx().
*
*       This bit is set by wcspcx() when it derives PCi_ja and CDELTia from
*       CDi_ja via an orthonormal decomposition.  In particular, it signals
*       wcsset() not to replace PCi_ja by a copy of CDi_ja with CDELTia set
*       to unity.
*
*     CDi_ja and CROTAi keywords, if found, are to be stored in the wcsprm::cd
*     and wcsprm::crota arrays which are dimensioned similarly to wcsprm::pc
*     and wcsprm::cdelt.  FITS header parsers should use the following
*     procedure:
*
*     - Whenever a PCi_ja keyword is encountered: altlin |= 1;
*
*     - Whenever a CDi_ja keyword is encountered: altlin |= 2;
*
*     - Whenever a CROTAi keyword is encountered: altlin |= 4;
*
*     If none of these bits are set the PCi_ja representation results, i.e.
*     wcsprm::pc and wcsprm::cdelt will be used as given.
*
*     These alternate specifications of the linear transformation matrix are
*     translated immediately to PCi_ja by wcsset() and are invisible to the
*     lower-level WCSLIB routines.  In particular, unless bit 3 is also set,
*     wcsset() resets wcsprm::cdelt to unity if CDi_ja is present (and no
*     PCi_ja).
*
*     If CROTAi are present but none is associated with the latitude axis
*     (and no PCi_ja or CDi_ja), then wcsset() reverts to a unity PCi_ja
*     matrix.
*
*   int velref
*     (Given) AIPS velocity code VELREF, refer to spcaips().
*
*     It is not necessary to reset the wcsprm struct (via wcsset()) when

*

*     Although technically wcsprm::ntab and tab are "given", they will
*     normally be set by invoking wcstab(), whether directly or indirectly.
*
*     The tabprm structs contain some members that must be supplied and others
*     that are derived.  The information to be supplied comes primarily from
*     arrays stored in one or more FITS binary table extensions.  These
*     arrays, referred to here as "wcstab arrays", are themselves located by
*     parameters stored in the FITS image header.
*
*   struct wtbarr *wtb
*     (Given) Address of the first element of an array of nwtb wtbarr structs
*     for which memory has been allocated.  These are used in extracting
*     wcstab arrays from a FITS binary table.
*
*     Although technically wcsprm::nwtb and wtb are "given", they will
*     normally be set by invoking wcstab(), whether directly or indirectly.
*
*   char lngtyp[8]
*     (Returned) Four-character WCS celestial longitude and ...
*   char lattyp[8]
*     (Returned) ... latitude axis types. e.g. "RA", "DEC", "GLON", "GLAT",
*     etc. extracted from 'RA--', 'DEC-', 'GLON', 'GLAT', etc. in the first
*     four characters of CTYPEia but with trailing dashes removed.  (Declared
*     as char[8] for alignment reasons.)
*
*   int lng
*     (Returned) Index for the longitude coordinate, and ...
*   int lat
*     (Returned) ... index for the latitude coordinate, and ...
*   int spec
*     (Returned) ... index for the spectral coordinate in the imgcrd[][] and
*     world[][] arrays in the API of wcsp2s(), wcss2p() and wcsmix().
*
*     These may also serve as indices into the pixcrd[][] array provided that
*     the PCi_ja matrix does not transpose axes.
*
*   int cubeface
*     (Returned) Index into the pixcrd[][] array for the CUBEFACE axis.  This
*     is used for quadcube projections where the cube faces are stored on a
*     separate axis (see wcs.h).
*
*   int *types
*     (Returned) Address of the first element of an array of int containing a
*     four-digit type code for each axis.
*
*     - First digit (i.e. 1000s):
*       - 0: Non-specific coordinate type.
*       - 1: Stokes coordinate.
*       - 2: Celestial coordinate (including CUBEFACE).
*       - 3: Spectral coordinate.
*       - 4: Time coordinate.
*
*     - Second digit (i.e. 100s):
*       - 0: Linear axis.
*       - 1: Quantized axis (STOKES, CUBEFACE).
*       - 2: Non-linear celestial axis.
*       - 3: Non-linear spectral axis.
*       - 4: Logarithmic axis.
*       - 5: Tabular axis.
*
*     - Third digit (i.e. 10s):
*       - 0: Group number, e.g. lookup table number, being an index into the
*            tabprm array (see above).
*
*     - The fourth digit is used as a qualifier depending on the axis type.
*
*       - For celestial axes:
*         - 0: Longitude coordinate.
*         - 1: Latitude coordinate.
*         - 2: CUBEFACE number.
*
*       - For lookup tables: the axis number in a multidimensional table.
*
*     CTYPEia in "4-3" form with unrecognized algorithm code will have its
*     type set to -1 and generate an error.
