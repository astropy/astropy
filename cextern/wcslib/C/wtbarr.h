* WCSLIB 7.12 - C routines that implement the FITS World Coordinate System
* (WCS) standard.  Refer to the README file provided with WCSLIB for an
* overview of the library.
*
*
* Summary of the wtbarr struct
* ----------------------------
* The wtbarr struct is used by wcstab() in extracting coordinate lookup tables
* from a binary table extension (BINTABLE) and copying them into the tabprm
* structs stored in wcsprm.
*
*
* wtbarr struct - Extraction of coordinate lookup tables from BINTABLE
* --------------------------------------------------------------------
* Function wcstab(), which is invoked automatically by wcspih(), sets up an
* array of wtbarr structs to assist in extracting coordinate lookup tables
* from a binary table extension (BINTABLE) and copying them into the tabprm
* structs stored in wcsprm.  Refer to the usage notes for wcspih() and
* wcstab() in wcshdr.h, and also the prologue to tab.h.
*
* For C++ usage, because of a name space conflict with the wtbarr typedef
* defined in CFITSIO header fitsio.h, the wtbarr struct is renamed to wtbarr_s
* by preprocessor macro substitution with scope limited to wtbarr.h itself,
* and similarly in wcs.h.
*
*   int i
*     (Given) Image axis number.
*
*   int m
*     (Given) wcstab array axis number for index vectors.
*
*   int kind
*     (Given) Character identifying the wcstab array type:
*       - c: coordinate array,
*       - i: index vector.
*
*   char extnam[72]
*     (Given) EXTNAME identifying the binary table extension.
*
*   int extver
*     (Given) EXTVER identifying the binary table extension.
*
*   int extlev
*     (Given) EXTLEV identifying the binary table extension.
*
*   char ttype[72]
*     (Given) TTYPEn identifying the column of the binary table that contains
*     the wcstab array.
*
*   long row
*     (Given) Table row number.
*
*   int ndim
*     (Given) Expected dimensionality of the wcstab array.
*
*   int *dimlen
*     (Given) Address of the first element of an array of int of length ndim
*     into which the wcstab array axis lengths are to be written.
*
*   double **arrayp
*     (Given) Pointer to an array of double which is to be allocated by the
*     user and into which the wcstab array is to be written.
