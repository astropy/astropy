The Astropy Project (http://astropy.org/) is a community effort to develop a
single core package for Astronomy in Python and foster interoperability between
Python astronomy packages. This repository contains the core package which is
intended to contain much of the core functionality and some common tools needed
for performing astronomy and astrophysics with Python.

Releases are `registered on PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/astropy>`_,
and development is occurring at the
`project's GitHub page <http://github.com/astropy/astropy>`_.

For installation instructions, see the `online documentation <http://docs.astropy.org/>`_
or  `docs/install.rst <docs/install.rst>`_ in this source distribution.
