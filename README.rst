The Astropy Project (http://astropy.org/) is a community effort to develop a
single core package for Astronomy in Python and foster interoperability between
Python astronomy packages. This repository contains the core package which is
intended to contain much of the core functionality and some common tools needed
for performing astronomy and astrophysics with Python.

Releases are `registered on PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/astropy>`_,
and development is occurring at the
`project's github page <http://github.com/astropy/astropy>`_.

For installation instructions, see the `online documentation <http://docs.astropy.org/>`_
or  ``docs/install.rst`` in this source distribution.

For system packagers: Please install Astropy with the command::

    $ python setup.py --offline install

This will prevent the astropy_helpers bootstrap script from attempting to
reach out to PyPI.
