The Astropy Project (https://astropy.org/; documentation at https://docs.astropy.org/) is a community effort to develop a
single core package for astronomy in Python and foster interoperability between packages used in astronomy and astrophysics.
This repository contains the core library.

Installation
============

To install `astropy` from PyPI, use:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install astropy

For more detailed instructions, see the `install guide <https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/install.html>`_ in the docs.

Contributing
============

The Astropy Project is made both by and for its users, so we welcome and
encourage contributions of many kinds. Our goal is to keep this a positive,
inclusive, successful, and growing community that abides by the
`Astropy Community Code of Conduct <https://www.astropy.org/about.html#codeofconduct>`_.

For more detailed information on contributing to the project or submitting feedback, see the
`contributions page <https://www.astropy.org/contribute.html>`_.
The developer docs have a `guide <https://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/index_dev.html>`_ for contributing code,
and there's a `summary of contribution guidelines <CONTRIBUTING.md>`_.

Developing with Codespaces
==========================

GitHub Codespaces is a cloud development environment that can host a browser version of Visual Studio Code.
This is a convenient way to quickly start developing Astropy, with our `dev container <.devcontainer/devcontainer.json>`_ configured
with the required packages. For help, see the `GitHub Codespaces
docs <https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces>`_.
