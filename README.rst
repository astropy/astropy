Astropy (http://www.astropy.org) is a package intended to contain much of
the core functionality and some common tools needed for performing
astronomy and astrophysics with Python.

Releases are `registered on PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/astropy>`_,
and development is occurring at the
`project's github page <http://github.com/astropy/astropy>`_.

For installation instructions, see the `online documentation <http://docs.astropy.org/>`_
or  ``docs/install.rst`` in this source distribution.

For system packagers: Please install Astropy with the command::

    $ python setup.py --offline install

This will prevent the astropy_helpers bootstrap script from attempting to
reach out to PyPI.
