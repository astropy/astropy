External Packages/Libraries
===========================

This directory contains C extensions included with Astropy. Note that only C 
extensions should be included in this directory - pure Cython code should
be placed in the Astropy source tree, and wrapper Cython code for C libraries 
included here should be in the astropy/wrappers directory.
