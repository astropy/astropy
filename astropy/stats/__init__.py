"""
This subpackage contains statistical tools provided for or used by Astropy.

While the `scipy.stats` package contains a wide range of statistical
tools, it is a general-purpose package, and is missing some that are
particularly useful to astronomy or are used in an atypical way in
astronomy. This package is intended to provide such functionality, but
*not* to replace `scipy.stats` if its implementation satisfies
astronomers' needs.
