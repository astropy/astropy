    Downsample a time series by binning values into bins with a fixed size or
    custom sizes, using a single function to combine the values in the bin.

    Parameters
    ----------
    time_series : :class:`~astropy.timeseries.TimeSeries`
        The time series to downsample.
    time_bin_size : `~astropy.units.Quantity` or `~astropy.time.TimeDelta` ['time'], optional
        The time interval for the binned time series - this is either a scalar
        value (in which case all time bins will be assumed to have the same
        duration) or as an array of values (in which case each time bin can
        have a different duration). If this argument is provided,
        ``time_bin_end`` should not be provided.
    time_bin_start : `~astropy.time.Time` or iterable, optional
        The start time for the binned time series - this can be either given
        directly as a `~astropy.time.Time` array or as any iterable that
        initializes the `~astropy.time.Time` class. This can also be a scalar
        value if ``time_bin_size`` or ``time_bin_end`` is provided.
        Defaults to the first time in the sampled time series.
    time_bin_end : `~astropy.time.Time` or iterable, optional
        The times of the end of each bin - this can be either given directly as
        a `~astropy.time.Time` array or as any iterable that initializes the
        `~astropy.time.Time` class. This can only be given if ``time_bin_start``
        is provided or its default is used. If ``time_bin_end`` is scalar and
        ``time_bin_start`` is an array, time bins are assumed to be contiguous;
        the end of each bin is the start of the next one, and ``time_bin_end`` gives
        the end time for the last bin.  If ``time_bin_end`` is an array and
        ``time_bin_start`` is scalar, bins will be contiguous. If both ``time_bin_end``
        and ``time_bin_start`` are arrays, bins do not need to be contiguous.
        If this argument is provided, ``time_bin_size`` should not be provided.
    n_bins : int, optional
        The number of bins to use. Defaults to the number needed to fit all
        the original points. If both ``time_bin_start`` and ``time_bin_size``
        are provided and are scalar values, this determines the total bins
        within that interval. If ``time_bin_start`` is an iterable, this
        parameter will be ignored.
    aggregate_func : callable, optional
        The function to use for combining points in the same bin. Defaults
        to np.nanmean.

    Returns
    -------
    binned_time_series : :class:`~astropy.timeseries.BinnedTimeSeries`
        The downsampled time series.
