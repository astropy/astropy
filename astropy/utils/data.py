    appropriate compression libraries are provided by the Python installation.

    Notes
    -----

    This function is a context manager, and should be used for example
    as::

        with get_readable_fileobj('file.dat') as f:
            contents = f.read()

    If a URL is provided and the cache is in use, the provided URL will be the
    name used in the cache. The contents may already be stored in the cache
    under this URL provided, they may be downloaded from this URL, or they may
    be downloaded from one of the locations listed in ``sources``. See
    `~download_file` for details.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name_or_obj : str or file-like object
        The filename of the file to access (if given as a string), or
        the file-like object to access.

        If a file-like object, it must be opened in binary mode.

    encoding : str, optional
        When `None` (default), returns a file-like object with a
        ``read`` method that returns `str` (``unicode``) objects, using
        `locale.getpreferredencoding` as an encoding.  This matches
        the default behavior of the built-in `open` when no ``mode``
        argument is provided.

        When ``'binary'``, returns a file-like object where its ``read``
        method returns `bytes` objects.

        When another string, it is the name of an encoding, and the
        file-like object's ``read`` method will return `str` (``unicode``)
        objects, decoded from binary using the given encoding.

    cache : bool or "update", optional
        Whether to cache the contents of remote URLs. If "update",
        check the remote URL for a new version but store the result
        in the cache.

    show_progress : bool, optional
        Whether to display a progress bar if the file is downloaded
        from a remote server.  Default is `True`.

    remote_timeout : float
        Timeout for remote requests in seconds (default is the configurable
        `astropy.utils.data.Conf.remote_timeout`, which is 3s by default)

    sources : list of str, optional
        If provided, a list of URLs to try to obtain the file from. The
        result will be stored under the original URL. The original URL
        will *not* be tried unless it is in this list; this is to prevent
        long waits for a primary server that is known to be inaccessible
        at the moment.

    http_headers : dict or None
        HTTP request headers to pass into ``urlopen`` if needed. (These headers
        are ignored if the protocol for the ``name_or_obj``/``sources`` entry
        is not a remote HTTP URL.) In the default case (None), the headers are
        ``User-Agent: some_value`` and ``Accept: */*``, where ``some_value``
        is set by ``astropy.utils.data.conf.default_http_user_agent``.

    """
    Retrieves a data file from the standard locations for the package and
    provides the file as a file-like object that reads bytes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data_name : str
        Name/location of the desired data file.  One of the following:

            * The name of a data file included in the source
              distribution.  The path is relative to the module
              calling this function.  For example, if calling from
              ``astropy.pkname``, use ``'data/file.dat'`` to get the
              file in ``astropy/pkgname/data/file.dat``.  Double-dots
              can be used to go up a level.  In the same example, use
              ``'../data/file.dat'`` to get ``astropy/data/file.dat``.
            * If a matching local file does not exist, the Astropy
              data server will be queried for the file.
            * A hash like that produced by `compute_hash` can be
              requested, prefixed by 'hash/'
              e.g. 'hash/34c33b3eb0d56eb9462003af249eff28'.  The hash
              will first be searched for locally, and if not found,
              the Astropy data server will be queried.

    package : str, optional
        If specified, look for a file relative to the given package, rather
        than the default of looking relative to the calling module's package.

    encoding : str, optional
        When `None` (default), returns a file-like object with a
        ``read`` method returns `str` (``unicode``) objects, using
        `locale.getpreferredencoding` as an encoding.  This matches
        the default behavior of the built-in `open` when no ``mode``
        argument is provided.

        When ``'binary'``, returns a file-like object where its ``read``
        method returns `bytes` objects.

        When another string, it is the name of an encoding, and the
        file-like object's ``read`` method will return `str` (``unicode``)
        objects, decoded from binary using the given encoding.

    cache : bool
        If True, the file will be downloaded and saved locally or the
        already-cached local copy will be accessed. If False, the
        file-like object will directly access the resource (e.g. if a
        remote URL is accessed, an object like that from
        `urllib.request.urlopen` is returned).

    Returns
    -------
    fileobj : file-like
        An object with the contents of the data file available via
        ``read`` function.  Can be used as part of a ``with`` statement,
        automatically closing itself after the ``with`` block.

    Raises
    ------
    urllib.error.URLError
        If a remote file cannot be found.
    OSError
        If problems occur writing or reading a local file.

    Examples
    --------

    This will retrieve a data file and its contents for the `astropy.wcs`
    tests::

        >>> from astropy.utils.data import get_pkg_data_fileobj
        >>> with get_pkg_data_fileobj('data/3d_cd.hdr',
        ...                           package='astropy.wcs.tests') as fobj:
        ...     fcontents = fobj.read()
        ...

    This next example would download a data file from the astropy data server
    because the ``allsky/allsky_rosat.fits`` file is not present in the
    source distribution.  It will also save the file locally so the
    next time it is accessed it won't need to be downloaded.::

        >>> from astropy.utils.data import get_pkg_data_fileobj
        >>> with get_pkg_data_fileobj('allsky/allsky_rosat.fits',
        ...                           encoding='binary') as fobj:  # doctest: +REMOTE_DATA +IGNORE_OUTPUT
        ...     fcontents = fobj.read()
        ...
        Downloading http://data.astropy.org/allsky/allsky_rosat.fits [Done]

    This does the same thing but does *not* cache it locally::

        >>> with get_pkg_data_fileobj('allsky/allsky_rosat.fits',
        ...                           encoding='binary', cache=False) as fobj:  # doctest: +REMOTE_DATA +IGNORE_OUTPUT
        ...     fcontents = fobj.read()

        Whether to display a progress bar if the file is downloaded
        from a remote server.  Default is `True`.

    remote_timeout : float
        Timeout for the requests in seconds (default is the
        configurable `astropy.utils.data.Conf.remote_timeout`, which
        is 3s by default)

    Raises
    ------
    urllib.error.URLError

    Returns
    -------
    filename : str
        A file path on the local file system corresponding to the data
        requested in ``data_name``.

    Examples
    --------

    encoding : str, optional
        When `None` (default), returns a file-like object with a
        ``read`` method that returns `str` (``unicode``) objects, using
        `locale.getpreferredencoding` as an encoding.  This matches
        the default behavior of the built-in `open` when no ``mode``

    cache : bool

def download_file(remote_url, cache=False, show_progress=True, timeout=None,

                  ftp_tls=False):
    """Downloads a URL and optionally caches the result.

    It returns the filename of a file containing the URL's contents.
    If ``cache=True`` and the file is present in the cache, just
    returns the filename; if the file had to be downloaded, add it
    to the cache.

    The cache is effectively a dictionary mapping URLs to files; by default the
    file contains the contents of the URL that is its key, but in practice
    these can be obtained from a mirror (using ``sources``) or imported from
    the local filesystem (using `~import_file_to_cache` or
    `~import_download_cache`).  Regardless, each file is regarded as
    representing the contents of a particular URL, and this URL should be used
    to look them up or otherwise manipulate them.

    The files in the cache directory are named according to a cryptographic
    hash of their contents (currently MD5, so hackers can cause collisions).
    Thus files with the same content share storage. The modification times on
    these files normally indicate when they were last downloaded from the
    Internet.

    Parameters
    ----------
    remote_url : str
        The URL of the file to download

    cache : bool or "update", optional
        Whether to cache the contents of remote URLs. If "update",
        always download the remote URL in case there is a new version
        and store the result in the cache.

    show_progress : bool, optional
        Whether to display a progress bar during the download (default
        is `True`). Regardless of this setting, the progress bar is only
        displayed when outputting to a terminal.

    timeout : float, optional
        The timeout, in seconds.  Otherwise, use
        `astropy.utils.data.Conf.remote_timeout`.

    sources : list of str, optional
        If provided, a list of URLs to try to obtain the file from. The
        result will be stored under the original URL. The original URL
        will *not* be tried unless it is in this list; this is to prevent
        long waits for a primary server that is known to be inaccessible
        at the moment. If an empty list is passed, then ``download_file``
        will not attempt to connect to the Internet.

    pkgname : `str`, optional
        The package name to use to locate the download cache. i.e. for
        ``pkgname='astropy'`` the default cache location is
        ``~/.astropy/cache``.

    http_headers : dict or None
        HTTP request headers to pass into ``urlopen`` if needed. (These headers
        are ignored if the protocol for the ``name_or_obj``/``sources`` entry
        is not a remote HTTP URL.) In the default case (None), the headers are
        ``User-Agent: some_value`` and ``Accept: */*``, where ``some_value``
        is set by ``astropy.utils.data.conf.default_http_user_agent``.

    ftp_tls : bool
        If True, use TLS with ftp URLs instead of the standard unsecured FTP.

    Returns
    -------
    local_path : str
        Returns the local path that the file was download to.

    Raises
    ------
    urllib.error.URLError
        Whenever there's a problem getting the remote file.

    Notes
    -----
    Because this returns a filename, another process could run
    clear_download_cache before you actually open the file, leaving
    you with a filename that no longer points to a usable file.

            ``False`` will print a Warning and set it to ``"update"`` again,
            because the function will not work properly without cache. Using

            function will not work properly without cache.

    show_progress : bool, optional
        Whether to display a progress bar during the download (default
        is `True`)

    timeout : float, optional
        Timeout for each individual requests in seconds (default is the
        configurable `astropy.utils.data.Conf.remote_timeout`).

    sources : dict, optional
        If provided, for each URL a list of URLs to try to obtain the
        file from. The result will be stored under the original URL.
        For any URL in this dictionary, the original URL will *not* be
        tried unless it is in this list; this is to prevent long waits
        for a primary server that is known to be inaccessible at the
        moment.

    multiprocessing_start_method : str, optional
        Useful primarily for testing; if in doubt leave it as the default.
        When using multiprocessing, certain anomalies occur when starting
        processes with the "spawn" method (the only option on Windows);
        other anomalies occur with the "fork" method (the default on
        Linux).

    pkgname : `str`, optional
        The package name to use to locate the download cache. i.e. for
        ``pkgname='astropy'`` the default cache location is
        ``~/.astropy/cache``.

    Returns
    -------
    paths : list of str
        The local file paths corresponding to the downloaded URLs.

    Notes
    -----
    If a URL is unreachable, the downloading will grind to a halt and the
    exception will propagate upward, but an unpredictable number of
    files will have been successfully downloaded and will remain in

    Because the cache is shared by all versions of astropy in all virtualenvs

    detects a number of incorrect conditions, including nonexistent files that

    request it, files whose content does not match the hash that is indexed.

    This function also returns a list of non-indexed files. A few will be
    associated with the shelve object; their exact names depend on the backend
    used but will probably be based on ``urlmap``. The presence of other files
    probably indicates that something has gone wrong and inaccessible files
    have accumulated in the cache. These can be removed with
    `clear_download_cache`, either passing the filename returned here, or
    with no arguments to empty the entire cache and return it to a

    cache, it is possible for them to delete files that are listed in this
    dictionary. Use with some caution if you are working on a system that is
    busy with many running astropy processes, although the same issues apply to
    most functions in this module.

    Parameters
    ----------
    filename_or_obj : str or file-like
        Where to put the created ZIP file. Must be something the zipfile
        module can write to.
    urls : iterable of str or None
        The URLs to include in the exported cache. The default is all
        URLs currently in the cache. If a URL is included in this list
        but is not currently in the cache, a KeyError will be raised.
        To ensure that all are in the cache use `~download_file`
        or `~download_files_in_parallel`.
    overwrite : bool, optional
        If filename_or_obj is a filename that exists, it will only be
        overwritten if this is True.
    pkgname : `str`, optional
        The package name to use to locate the download cache. i.e. for
        ``pkgname='astropy'`` the default cache location is
        ``~/.astropy/cache``.
