class NDData(NDDataBase):
    """
    A container for `~numpy.ndarray`-based datasets, using the
    `~astropy.nddata.NDDataBase` interface.

    The key distinction from raw `numpy.ndarray` is the presence of
    additional metadata such as uncertainty, mask, unit, a coordinate system
    and/or a `dict` containg further meta information. This class *only*
    provides a container for *storing* such datasets. For further functionality
    take a look at the ``See also`` section.

    Parameters
    -----------
    data : `~numpy.ndarray`-like, `NDData`-like or list
        The dataset.

    uncertainty : any type, optional
        Uncertainty in the dataset.
        Should have an attribute
        ``uncertainty_type`` that defines what kind of uncertainty is stored,
        such as ``'std'`` for standard deviation or
        ``'var'`` for variance. A metaclass defining such an interface is
        `~astropy.nddata.NDUncertainty` but isn't mandatory.
        Defaults to ``None``.

        TODO: *Must* or *Should* have this ``uncertainty_type``? (mwcraig)
        I implemented UnknownUncertainty to work around that so what is
        saved in _uncertainty has an uncertainty_type but it's unknown :-)

    mask : any type, optional
        Mask for the dataset.
        Masks should follow the `numpy` convention that valid data points are
        marked by ``False`` and invalid ones with ``True``.
        Defaults to ``None``.

    wcs : Ã ny type, optional
        A world coordinate system (WCS) for the dataset.
        Default is ``None``.

    meta : `dict`-like object, optional
        Meta information about the dataset. If no meta is provided an empty
        `collections.OrderedDict` is created.

    unit : `~astropy.units.Unit`-like or str, optional
        Unit for the dataset.
        Default is ``None``.

    copy : `bool`, optional
        Save the attributes as copy or as reference. ``True`` copies every
        attribute before saving it while ``False`` tries to save every
        parameter as reference. Note however that it is not always possible to
        save each input as reference.
        Default is ``False``.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError:
        In case any parameter does not fulfill the classes restrictions.

    Notes
    -----
    Each attribute can be accessed through the homonymous instance attribute,
    such as data in a `NDData` object can be accessed through the ``data``
    attribute.

    For example::

        >>> from astropy.nddata import NDData
        >>> nd = NDData([1,2,3])
        >>> nd.data
        array([1, 2, 3])

    Given an implicit parameter and an explicit one during initialization, for
    example the ``data`` is a `~astropy.units.Quantity` and the unit parameter
    is not None. Then the implicit parameter is replaced (without conversion)
    by the explicit one and a warning is issued::

        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> import astropy.units as u
        >>> q = np.array([1,2,3,4]) * u.m
        >>> nd2 = NDData(q, unit=u.cm)  # doctest: +SKIP
        INFO: Overwriting Quantity's current unit with specified unit [astropy.nddata.nddata]
        >>> nd2.data  # doctest: +SKIP
        array([ 1.,  2.,  3.,  4.])
        >>> nd2.unit  # doctest: +SKIP
        Unit("cm")
