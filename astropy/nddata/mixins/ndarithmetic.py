    Performs {name} by evaluating ``self`` {op} ``operand``.

    For the inverse operation or operations between different subclasses take a
    look at
    :meth:`~astropy.nddata.NDArithmeticMixin.ic_{name}` .

    Parameters
    ----------
    operand : `NDData`-like instance or convertible to one.
        The second operand in the operation.

    propagate_uncertainties : `bool` or ``None``, optional
        If ``None`` the result will have no uncertainty. If ``False`` the
        result will have a copied version of the first operand that has an
        uncertainty. If ``True`` the result will have a correctly propagated
        uncertainty from the uncertainties of the operands but this assumes
        that the uncertainties are `NDUncertainty`-like. Default is ``True``.

    handle_mask : callable, ``'first_found'`` or ``None``, optional
        If ``None`` the result will have no mask. If ``'first_found'`` the
        result will have a copied version of the first operand that has a
        mask). If it is a callable then the specified callable must
        create the results ``mask`` and if necessary provide a copy.
        Default is `numpy.logical_or`.

    handle_meta : callable, ``'first_found'`` or ``None``, optional
        If ``None`` the result will have no meta. If ``'first_found'`` the
        result will have a copied version of the first operand that has a
        (not empty) meta. If it is a callable then the specified callable must
        create the results ``meta`` and if necessary provide a copy.
        Default is ``None``.

    compare_wcs : callable, ``'first_found'`` or ``None``, optional
        If ``None`` the result will have no wcs and no comparison between
        the wcs of the operands is made. If ``'first_found'`` the
        result will have a copied version of the first operand that has a
        wcs. If it is a callable then the specified callable must
        compare the ``wcs``. The resulting ``wcs`` will be like if ``False``
        was given otherwise it raises a ``ValueError`` if the comparison was
        not successful. Default is ``'first_found'``.

    uncertainty_correlation : number or `~numpy.ndarray`, optional
        The correlation between the two operands is used for correct error
        propagation for correlated data as given in:
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagation_of_uncertainty#Example_formulas
        Default is 0.


    kwargs :
        Any other parameter that should be passed to the callables used.

    Returns
    -------
    result : `~astropy.nddata.NDData`-like
        The resulting dataset

    Notes
    -----
    If a ``callable`` is used for ``mask``, ``wcs`` or ``meta`` the
    callable must accept the corresponding attributes as first two
    parameters. If the callable also needs additional parameters these can be
    defined as ``kwargs`` and must start with ``"wcs_"`` (for wcs callable) or
    ``"meta_"`` (for meta callable). This startstring is removed before the
    callable is called.

_arit_cls_doc = """
    Like :meth:`NDArithmeticMixin.{0}` you can {0} two operands.

    This method is avaiable as classmethod in order to allow arithmetic
    operations between arbitary objects as long as they are convertable to
    the class that called the method. Therefore the name prefix ``ic_`` which
    stands for ``interclass`` operations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    operand1 : `NDData`-like or convertable to `NDData`
        the first operand in the operation.

    operand2 : `NDData`-like or convertable to `NDData`
        the second operand in the operation.

    kwargs :
        see :meth:`NDArithmeticMixin.{0}`

    Returns
    -------
    result : `NDData`-like
        The result of the operation. The class of the result is the class from
        where the method was invoked.
    """


class NDArithmeticMixin(object):
    """
    Mixin class to add arithmetic to an NDData object.

    When subclassing, be sure to list the superclasses in the correct order
    so that the subclass sees NDData as the main superclass. See
    `~astropy.nddata.NDDataArray` for an example.

    Notes
    -----
    This class only aims at covering the most common cases so there are certain
    restrictions on the saved attributes::

        - ``uncertainty`` : has to be something that has a `NDUncertainty`-like
          interface for uncertainty propagation
        - ``mask`` : has to be something that can be used by a bitwise ``or``
          operation.
        - ``wcs`` : has to implement a way of comparing with ``=`` to allow
          the operation.

    But there is a workaround that allows to disable handling a specific
    attribute and to simply set the results attribute to ``None`` or to
    copy the existing attribute (and neglecting the other).
    For example for uncertainties not representing an `NDUncertainty`-like
    interface you can alter the ``propagate_uncertainties`` parameter in
    :meth:`NDArithmeticMixin.add`. ``None`` means that the result will have no
    uncertainty, ``False`` means it takes the uncertainty of the first operand
    (if this does not exist from the second operand) as the result's
    uncertainty. This behaviour is also explained in the docstring for the
    different arithmetic operations.

    Notes
    -----
    1. It is not tried to decompose the units, mainly due to the internal
       mechanics of `~astropy.units.Quantity`, so the resulting data might have
       units like ``km/m`` if you divided for example 100km by 5m. So this
       Mixin has adopted this behaviour.

    Examples
    --------

    TODO: Just here because the examples fit more into the main documentation
    than in here.

    For example::

        >>> from astropy.nddata import *
        >>> class NDDataWithMath(NDArithmeticMixin, NDData): pass
        >>> nd = NDDataWithMath([1,2,3], unit='meter')
        >>> nd_inv = nd.ic_division(1, nd)
        >>> nd_inv.__class__.__name__
        'NDDataWithMath'
        >>> nd_inv.data
        array([ 1.        ,  0.5       ,  0.33333333])
        >>> nd_inv.unit
        Unit("1 / m")

    This method also allows that the result of unrelated objects is tried
    with what this class implements as arithmetics and give a result that
    is the same class as the class that called the method.

        >>> nd2 = nd.ic_multiplication([1,2],3)
        >>> nd2.__class__.__name__
        'NDDataWithMath'
        >>> nd2.data
        array([3, 6])

    Since this is a classmethod we don't need an instance to use them:

        >>> nd3 = NDDataWithMath.ic_subtraction(5, NDData([1,2,3]))
        >>> nd3.__class__.__name__
        'NDDataWithMath'
        >>> nd3.data
        array([4, 3, 2])

    And it allows to handle arithmetics with different subclasses.

        >>> class NDDataWithMathAndSlicing(NDSlicingMixin,NDArithmeticMixin, NDData): pass
        >>> nd = NDDataWithMath([5,5,5])
        >>> nd2 = NDDataWithMathAndSlicing([3,2,5])
        >>> nd3 = nd2.ic_addition(nd, nd2)
        >>> nd3.__class__.__name__
        'NDDataWithMathAndSlicing'
        >>> nd3.data
        array([ 8,  7, 10])
