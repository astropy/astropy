    Performs {name} by evaluating ``self`` {op} ``operand``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    operand, operand2 : `NDData`-like instance or convertible to one.
        If ``operand2`` is ``None`` or not given it will perform the operation
        ``self`` {op} ``operand``.
        If ``operand2`` is given it will perform ``operand`` {op} ``operand2``.
        If the method was called on a class rather than on the instance
        ``operand2`` must be given.

    propagate_uncertainties : `bool` or ``None``, optional
        If ``None`` the result will have no uncertainty. If ``False`` the
        result will have a copied version of the first operand that has an
        uncertainty. If ``True`` the result will have a correctly propagated
        uncertainty from the uncertainties of the operands but this assumes
        that the uncertainties are `NDUncertainty`-like. Default is ``True``.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.2
            This parameter must be given as keyword-parameter. Using it as
            positional parameter is deprecated.
            ``None`` was added as valid parameter value.

    handle_mask : callable, ``'first_found'`` or ``None``, optional
        If ``None`` the result will have no mask. If ``'first_found'`` the
        result will have a copied version of the first operand that has a
        mask). If it is a callable then the specified callable must
        create the results ``mask`` and if necessary provide a copy.
        Default is `numpy.logical_or`.

        .. versionadded:: 1.2

    handle_meta : callable, ``'first_found'`` or ``None``, optional
        If ``None`` the result will have no meta. If ``'first_found'`` the
        result will have a copied version of the first operand that has a
        (not empty) meta. If it is a callable then the specified callable must
        create the results ``meta`` and if necessary provide a copy.
        Default is ``None``.

        .. versionadded:: 1.2

    compare_wcs : callable, ``'first_found'`` or ``None``, optional
        If ``None`` the result will have no wcs and no comparison between
        the wcs of the operands is made. If ``'first_found'`` the
        result will have a copied version of the first operand that has a
        wcs. If it is a callable then the specified callable must
        compare the ``wcs``. The resulting ``wcs`` will be like if ``False``
        was given otherwise it raises a ``ValueError`` if the comparison was
        not successful. Default is ``'first_found'``.

        .. versionadded:: 1.2

    uncertainty_correlation : number or `~numpy.ndarray`, optional
        The correlation between the two operands is used for correct error
        propagation for correlated data as given in:
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagation_of_uncertainty#Example_formulas
        Default is 0.

        .. versionadded:: 1.2


    kwargs :
        Any other parameter that should be passed to the callables used.

    Returns
    -------
    result : `~astropy.nddata.NDData`-like
        The resulting dataset

    Notes
    -----
    If a ``callable`` is used for ``mask``, ``wcs`` or ``meta`` the
    callable must accept the corresponding attributes as first two
    parameters. If the callable also needs additional parameters these can be
    defined as ``kwargs`` and must start with ``"wcs_"`` (for wcs callable) or
    ``"meta_"`` (for meta callable). This startstring is removed before the
    callable is called.

    ``"first_found"`` can also be abbreviated with ``"ff"``.

class NDArithmeticMixin:
    """
    Mixin class to add arithmetic to an NDData object.

    When subclassing, be sure to list the superclasses in the correct order
    so that the subclass sees NDData as the main superclass. See
    `~astropy.nddata.NDDataArray` for an example.

    Notes
    -----
    This class only aims at covering the most common cases so there are certain
    restrictions on the saved attributes::

        - ``uncertainty`` : has to be something that has a `NDUncertainty`-like
          interface for uncertainty propagation
        - ``mask`` : has to be something that can be used by a bitwise ``or``
          operation.
        - ``wcs`` : has to implement a way of comparing with ``=`` to allow
          the operation.

    But there is a workaround that allows to disable handling a specific
    attribute and to simply set the results attribute to ``None`` or to
    copy the existing attribute (and neglecting the other).
    For example for uncertainties not representing an `NDUncertainty`-like
    interface you can alter the ``propagate_uncertainties`` parameter in
    :meth:`NDArithmeticMixin.add`. ``None`` means that the result will have no
    uncertainty, ``False`` means it takes the uncertainty of the first operand
    (if this does not exist from the second operand) as the result's
    uncertainty. This behavior is also explained in the docstring for the
    different arithmetic operations.

    Decomposing the units is not attempted, mainly due to the internal mechanics
    of `~astropy.units.Quantity`, so the resulting data might have units like
    ``km/m`` if you divided for example 100km by 5m. So this Mixin has adopted
    this behavior.

    Examples
    --------
    Using this Mixin with `~astropy.nddata.NDData`:

        >>> from astropy.nddata import NDData, NDArithmeticMixin
        >>> class NDDataWithMath(NDArithmeticMixin, NDData):
        ...     pass

    Using it with one operand on an instance::

        >>> ndd = NDDataWithMath(100)
        >>> ndd.add(20)
        NDDataWithMath(120)

    Using it with two operand on an instance::

        >>> ndd = NDDataWithMath(-4)
        >>> ndd.divide(1, ndd)
        NDDataWithMath(-0.25)

    Using it as classmethod requires two operands::

        >>> NDDataWithMath.subtract(5, 4)
        NDDataWithMath(1)

            Do not override this method in subclasses.

        This method checks if it was called as instance or as class method and
        then wraps the operands and the result from ``_arithmetics`` in the
        appropriate subclass.

        Parameters
        ----------
        self_or_cls : instance or class
            ``sharedmethod`` behaves like a normal method if called on the
            instance (then this parameter is ``self``) but like a classmethod
            when called on the class (then this parameter is ``cls``).

        operations : callable
            The operation (normally a numpy-ufunc) that represents the
            appropriate action.

        operand, operand2, kwargs :
            See for example ``add``.

        Result
        ------
        result : `~astropy.nddata.NDData`-like
            Depending how this method was called either ``self_or_cls``
            (called on class) or ``self_or_cls.__class__`` (called on instance)
            is the NDData-subclass that is used as wrapper for the result.
