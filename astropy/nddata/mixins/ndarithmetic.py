        Base method which calculates the result of the arithmetic operation.

        This class determines the result of the arithmetic operation on the
        `data` with respect to their units and then forwards to other methods
        to calculate the other properties for the result (like uncertainty).

        Parameters
        ----------
        operation: `str`
            The operation that is performed on the `NDData`. Supported are
            ``addition``, ``subtraction``, ``multiplication`` and ``division``.

        operand: `NDData` instance or something that can be converted to one.
            The second operand in the operation.

        uncertainty_correlation: ``Number`` or `~numpy.ndarray`
            The correlation (rho) is defined between the uncertainties in
            sigma_AB = sigma_A * sigma_B * rho. If
            `propagate_uncertainty` is ``False`` this will be ignored. A value
            of ``0`` means uncorrelated (which is also the default)

        meta_kwds_operate: ``None`` or `list`
            If ``None`` no arithmetic meta operations are done. If this is a
            list then each element of the list will be interpreted as a
            keyword which should be arithmetically changed. In case both
            operands have not-empty meta properties the resulting meta keyword
            will be operand1 keyword operated upon operand2 keyword. If only
            one operand has a not-empty meta, the resulting keyword will be
            the keyword of the operand operated with the ``data`` (this is
            only allowed if the data is actually a scalar) of the other
            operand. (There will be more explanation and exampled sometime
            soon)

        meta_kwds_set: ``None`` or `dict`
            If ``None`` there are no keyword settings after the arithmetic
            meta keyword operations. If this is a `dict` each key/value pair
            in the `meta_kwds_set` will be added (or replaced if the keyword
            already exists) in the results meta.

        handle_uncertainties: `bool`
            If ``True`` it will be tried to propagate the uncertainties. If
            ``False`` the results uncertainty will be the uncertainty of the
            instance which called this method.
        handle_mask: `bool`
            If ``True`` the mask of the result will be processed by
            `_arithmetic_mask`. If ``False`` the result will not have a mask.
        check_wcs: `bool`
            If ``True`` the wcs of both operands will be tested for equality.
            If ``False`` this will not be tested. The result will contain the
            wcs information of the first operand except if the first operand
            has no wcs information and the second has, then the wcs information
            from the second operand will be kept.

        Returns
        -------
        result: `NDData` subclass
            The result as the same class as the first operand in the operation.

        Notes
        -----
        1. Due to the internal mechanics of `~astropy.units.Quantity` the
           resulting data might have units like ``km/m```if you divided for
           example 100km by 5m. So this class has adopted this behaviour.
        2. Uncertainty propagation allows that the unit of the uncertainty
           differs from the unit of the data. In these cases uncertainty
           propagation *trys* to keep these units but sometimes this will
           not be possible. Maybe it is possible but that's not so easy right
           now and therefore if you use different units for uncertainty and
           data there might be cases where the uncertainty's unit may seem
           rather odd after an arithmetic operation.
        3. Internally all properties of the base NDData are determined and then
           the new subclass is created. So if you need to extend this class to
           handle other properties as well but keep the existing operations
           just call ``result=super('yourclass', self)._arithmetic`` and then
           append the additional properties via setters.
