class NDSlicingMixin(object):
    """
    Mixin to provide slicing on objects using the NDData interface.

    The most common cases of the properties of `~astropy.nddata.NDData` are
    covered, i.e. if uncertainty, mask and wcs are ``None`` or
    `~numpy.ndarray` (see Notes for complete list of restrictions) but since
    NDData deliberatly enforces nothing on most of it's properties there might
    be a need to extend this. The `NDSlicingMixin` was designed to allow
    subclasses to extend just the portion they need changing without having
    to rewrite the whole Mixin (see Notes for detailed suggestions on how
    to do that).

    TODO: Move Notes to nddata/subclassing.rst

    Notes
    -----
    1. When subclassing, be sure to list the superclasses in the correct order
       so that the subclass sees NDData as the main superclass. See
       `~astropy.nddata.NDDataArray` for an example.

    2. Since `~astropy.nddata.NDData` is not very restrictive about what the
       additional attributes can be there are a lot of tests while slicing.
       If a subclass defines more restrictive setter methods for the properties
       they might want to consider altering `NDSlicingMixin` methods for
       slicing (starting with _slice_* e.g.
       `NDSlicingMixin._slice_uncertainty`). Currently implemented is the
       for slicing the:

       - data (which is enforced to be something like a `~numpy.ndarray`)
       - mask (if it is a numpy array)
       - wcs (if it is a numpy array or `~astropy.wcs.WCS` object)
       - uncertainty (if it is a numpy array or a subclass of `NDUncertainty`)

       But only if the shapes match the shape of the data (except for the wcs
       if it is a ``WCS`` object). If these attributes do not match those
       criterias the original property is used but an ``INFO`` message is
       displayed. The ``meta`` and ``unit`` are simply taken from the original.

    3. Some advice about extending this Mixin in subclasses:

       - if the ``data`` is not a `~numpy.ndarray` or should not be sliceable
         you may be better off not using this Mixin.
       - if you have defined an additional property that needs to be sliced
         extend :meth:`NDSlicingMixin._slice`. Probably the best way to do this
         is to first call ``kwarg = super(subclass, self)._slice(item)`` in
         there and then just afterwards add the other sliced properties to the
         ``kwarg``-dict. Since this kwarg is used to initialize a new
         instance of the class you need to match the key to the name of the
         parameter. For example if you use a property called ``flags`` you need
         to add a new line ``kwargs['flags'] = ...`` to :meth:`_slice`.
         *BUT* the ``__init__`` has to accept a flags parameter otherwise
         this will fail.
       - if you have restrictions that are a subset of the above mentioned
         conditions on the properties do not override or extend the
         ``_slice_*`` methods. The speed gain is negligible.
       - if you have a property that does not match the criterias above you may
         need to extend or override some method here. For example you want a
         custom made ``uncertainty`` class that does not subclass from
         `NDUncertainty` or `~numpy.ndarray` to be sliced. The best way to do
         this would be to extend ``_slice_uncertainty(self, item)`` which
         takes the ``slice`` as ``item`` parameter and returns what the
         sliced uncertainty should be. The current uncertainty is avaiable
         using ``self._uncertainty``. Be carful since this can be also ``None``
         if there is no uncertainty set.

    Examples
    --------

        >>> from astropy.nddata import NDData, NDSlicingMixin

        >>> nd[1:3]
        NDDataSliceable([2, 3])
        >>> import numpy as np # Mask has to be a numpy array to be sliceable
        >>> mask = np.array([True, False, True, True, False])
        >>> nd2 = NDDataSliceable(nd, mask=mask)
        >>> nd2[1:3].mask
        array([False,  True], dtype=bool)
        >>> # But be aware that the slicing only returns references not copies
        >>> nd3 = nd2[1:3]
        >>> nd3.data[0] = 100
        >>> nd2
        NDDataSliceable([  1, 100,   3,   4,   5])
        >>> # If the mask is not a numpy array a warning is issued
        >>> nd4 = NDDataSliceable(nd, mask=[False, True])
        >>> nd5 = nd4[0:2] # doctest: +SKIP

        >>> nd5 # doctest: +SKIP
