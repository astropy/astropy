def overlap_slices(large_array_shape, small_array_shape, position):
    """
    Get slices for the overlapping part of a small and a large array.

    Given a certain position of the center of the small array, with
    respect to the large array, tuples of slices are returned which can be
    used to extract, add or subtract the small array at the given
    position. This function takes care of the correct behavior at the
    boundaries, where the small array is cut of appropriately.

    Parameters
    ----------
    large_array_shape : tuple
        Shape of the large array.
    small_array_shape : tuple
        Shape of the small array.
    position : tuple of integers
        Position of the small array's center, with respect to the large array.
        Coordinates should be in the same order as the array shape.
        When determining the center for a coordinate with an even number of
        elements, the position is rounded up. So the coordinates of the
        center of an array with shape=(2,3) will be (1,1).

    Returns
    -------
    slices_large : tuple of slices
        Slices in all directions for the large array, such that
        ``large_array[slices_large]`` extracts the region of the large array
        that overlaps with the small array.
    slices_small : slice
        Slices in all directions for the small array, such that
        ``small_array[slices_small]`` extracts the region that is inside the
        large array.

def extract_array(array_large, shape, position):

    Extract smaller array of given shape and position out of a larger array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    array_large : `~numpy.ndarray`
        Array to extract another array from.
    shape : tuple
        Shape of the extracted array.
    position : tuple
        Position of the small array's center, with respect to the large array.

    -------
    array_small : `~numpy.ma.ndarray`
        The extracted array. Values that do not overlap with ``array_large``
        are masked.

    Examples
    --------
    We consider a large array with the shape 11x10, from which we extract
    a small array of shape 3x5:

    Add a smaller array at a given position in a larger array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    array_large : `~numpy.ndarray`
        Large array.
    array_small : `~numpy.ndarray`
        Small array to add.
    position : tuple
        Position of the small array's center, with respect to the large array.

    Returns
    -------
    new_array : `~numpy.ndarray`
        The new array formed from the sum of ``array_large`` and

    Notes
    -----

def subpixel_indices(position, subsampling):
    """
    Convert decimal points to indices, given a subsampling factor.

    This discards the integer part of the position and uses only the decimal
    place, and converts this to a subpixel position depending on the
    subsampling specified. The center of a pixel corresponds to an integer
    position.

    Parameters
    ----------
    position : `~numpy.ndarray` or array-like
        Positions in pixels.
    subsampling : int
        Subsampling factor per pixel.

    Returns
    -------
    indices : `~numpy.ndarray`
        The integer subpixel indices corresponding to the input positions.

    Examples
    --------

    If no subsampling is used, then the subpixel indices returned are always 0:

    >>> from astropy.nddata.utils import subpixel_indices
    >>> subpixel_indices([1.2, 3.4, 5.6],1)
    array([ 0.,  0.,  0.])

    If instead we use a subsampling of 2, we see that for the two first values
    (1.1 and 3.4) the subpixel position is 1, while for 5.6 it is 0. This is
    because the values of 1, 3, and 6 lie in the center of pixels, and 1.1 and
    3.4 lie in the left part of the pixels and 5.6 lies in the right part.
