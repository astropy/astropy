    """Find the redshift ``z`` at which ``func(z) = fval``.

    This finds the redshift at which one of the cosmology functions or
    methods (for example Planck13.distmod) is equal to a known value.

    .. warning::
       Make sure you understand the behavior of the function that you are
       trying to invert! Depending on the cosmology, there may not be a
       unique solution. For example, in the standard Lambda CDM cosmology,
       there are two redshifts which give an angular diameter distance of
       1500 Mpc, z ~ 0.7 and z ~ 3.8. To force ``z_at_value`` to find the
       solution you are interested in, use the ``zmin`` and ``zmax`` keywords
       to limit the search range (see the example below).

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : function or method
        A function that takes a redshift as input.

    fval : `~astropy.units.Quantity`
        The (scalar or array) value of ``func(z)`` to recover.

    zmin : float or array-like['dimensionless'] or quantity-like, optional
        The lower search limit for ``z``.  Beware of divergences
        in some cosmological functions, such as distance moduli,
        at z=0 (default 1e-8).

    zmax : float or array-like['dimensionless'] or quantity-like, optional
        The upper search limit for ``z`` (default 1000).

    ztol : float or array-like['dimensionless'], optional
        The relative error in ``z`` acceptable for convergence.

    maxfun : int or array-like, optional
        The maximum number of function evaluations allowed in the
        optimization routine (default 500).

    method : str or callable, optional
        Type of solver to pass to the minimizer. The built-in options provided
        by :func:`~scipy.optimize.minimize_scalar` are 'Brent' (default),
        'Golden' and 'Bounded' with names case insensitive - see documentation
        there for details. It also accepts a custom solver by passing any
        user-provided callable object that meets the requirements listed
        therein under the Notes on "Custom minimizers" - or in more detail in
        :doc:`scipy:tutorial/optimize` - although their use is currently
        untested.

        .. versionadded:: 4.3

    bracket : sequence or object array[sequence], optional
        For methods 'Brent' and 'Golden', ``bracket`` defines the bracketing
        interval and can either have three items (z1, z2, z3) so that
        z1 < z2 < z3 and ``func(z2) < func (z1), func(z3)`` or two items z1
        and z3 which are assumed to be a starting interval for a downhill
        bracket search. For non-monotonic functions such as angular diameter
        distance this may be used to start the search on the desired side of
        the maximum, but see Examples below for usage notes.

        .. versionadded:: 4.3

    verbose : bool, optional
        Print diagnostic output from solver (default `False`).

        .. versionadded:: 4.3

    Returns
    -------
    z : `~astropy.units.Quantity` ['redshift']
        The redshift ``z`` satisfying ``zmin < z < zmax`` and ``func(z) =
        fval`` within ``ztol``. Has units of cosmological redshift.

    Warns
    -----
    :class:`~astropy.utils.exceptions.AstropyUserWarning`
        If ``fval`` is not bracketed by ``func(zmin)=fval(zmin)`` and
        ``func(zmax)=fval(zmax)``.

        If the solver was not successful.

    Raises
    ------
    :class:`astropy.cosmology.CosmologyError`
        If the result is very close to either ``zmin`` or ``zmax``.
    ValueError
        If ``bracket`` is not an array nor a 2 (or 3) element sequence.
    TypeError
        If ``bracket`` is not an object array. 2 (or 3) element sequences will
        be turned into object arrays, so this error should only occur if a
        non-object array is used for ``bracket``.

    Notes
    -----
    This works for any arbitrary input cosmology, but is inefficient if you
    want to invert a large number of values for the same cosmology. In this
    case, it is faster to instead generate an array of values at many
    closely-spaced redshifts that cover the relevant redshift range, and then
    use interpolation to find the redshift at each value you are interested
    in. For example, to efficiently find the redshifts corresponding to 10^6
    values of the distance modulus in a Planck13 cosmology, you could do the
    following:

    >>> import astropy.units as u
    >>> from astropy.cosmology import Planck13, z_at_value

    Generate 10^6 distance moduli between 24 and 44 for which we
    want to find the corresponding redshifts:

    >>> Dvals = (24 + np.random.rand(1000000) * 20) * u.mag

    Make a grid of distance moduli covering the redshift range we
    need using 50 equally log-spaced values between zmin and
    zmax. We use log spacing to adequately sample the steep part of
    the curve at low distance moduli:

    >>> zmin = z_at_value(Planck13.distmod, Dvals.min())
    >>> zmax = z_at_value(Planck13.distmod, Dvals.max())
    >>> zgrid = np.geomspace(zmin, zmax, 50)
    >>> Dgrid = Planck13.distmod(zgrid)

    Finally interpolate to find the redshift at each distance modulus:

    >>> zvals = np.interp(Dvals.value, Dgrid.value, zgrid)

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import astropy.units as u
    >>> from astropy.cosmology import Planck13, Planck18, z_at_value

    The age and lookback time are monotonic with redshift, and so a
    unique solution can be found:

    >>> z_at_value(Planck13.age, 2 * u.Gyr)               # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP
    <Quantity 3.19812268 redshift>

    The angular diameter is not monotonic however, and there are two
    redshifts that give a value of 1500 Mpc. You can use the zmin and
    zmax keywords to find the one you are interested in:

    >>> z_at_value(Planck18.angular_diameter_distance,
    ...            1500 * u.Mpc, zmax=1.5)                # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP
    <Quantity 0.68044452 redshift>
    >>> z_at_value(Planck18.angular_diameter_distance,
    ...            1500 * u.Mpc, zmin=2.5)                # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP
    <Quantity 3.7823268 redshift>

    Alternatively the ``bracket`` option may be used to initialize the
    function solver on a desired region, but one should be aware that this
    does not guarantee it will remain close to this starting bracket.
    For the example of angular diameter distance, which has a maximum near
    a redshift of 1.6 in this cosmology, defining a bracket on either side
    of this maximum will often return a solution on the same side:

    >>> z_at_value(Planck18.angular_diameter_distance,
    ...            1500 * u.Mpc, bracket=(1.0, 1.2))  # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP +IGNORE_WARNINGS
    <Quantity 0.68044452 redshift>

    But this is not ascertained especially if the bracket is chosen too wide
    and/or too close to the turning point:

    >>> z_at_value(Planck18.angular_diameter_distance,
    ...            1500 * u.Mpc, bracket=(0.1, 1.5))           # doctest: +SKIP
    <Quantity 3.7823268 redshift>                              # doctest: +SKIP

    Likewise, even for the same minimizer and same starting conditions different
    results can be found depending on architecture or library versions:

    >>> z_at_value(Planck18.angular_diameter_distance,
    ...            1500 * u.Mpc, bracket=(2.0, 2.5))           # doctest: +SKIP
    <Quantity 3.7823268 redshift>                              # doctest: +SKIP

    >>> z_at_value(Planck18.angular_diameter_distance,
    ...            1500 * u.Mpc, bracket=(2.0, 2.5))           # doctest: +SKIP
    <Quantity 0.68044452 redshift>                             # doctest: +SKIP

    It is therefore generally safer to use the 3-parameter variant to ensure
    the solution stays within the bracketing limits:

    >>> z_at_value(Planck18.angular_diameter_distance, 1500 * u.Mpc,
    ...            bracket=(0.1, 1.0, 1.5))               # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP
    <Quantity 0.68044452 redshift>

    Also note that the luminosity distance and distance modulus (two
    other commonly inverted quantities) are monotonic in flat and open
    universes, but not in closed universes.

    All the arguments except ``func``, ``method`` and ``verbose`` accept array
    inputs. This does NOT use interpolation tables or any method to speed up
    evaluations, rather providing a convenient means to broadcast arguments
    over an element-wise scalar evaluation.

    The most common use case for non-scalar input is to evaluate 'func' for an
    array of ``fval``:

    >>> z_at_value(Planck13.age, [2, 7] * u.Gyr)          # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP
    <Quantity [3.19812061, 0.75620443] redshift>

    ``fval`` can be any shape:

    >>> z_at_value(Planck13.age, [[2, 7], [1, 3]]*u.Gyr)  # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP
    <Quantity [[3.19812061, 0.75620443],
               [5.67661227, 2.19131955]] redshift>

    Other arguments can be arrays. For non-monotic functions  -- for example,
    the angular diameter distance -- this can be useful to find all solutions.

    >>> z_at_value(Planck13.angular_diameter_distance, 1500 * u.Mpc,
    ...            zmin=[0, 2.5], zmax=[2, 4])            # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP
    <Quantity [0.68127747, 3.79149062] redshift>

    The ``bracket`` argument can likewise be be an array. However, since
    bracket must already be a sequence (or None), it MUST be given as an
    object `numpy.ndarray`. Importantly, the depth of the array must be such
    that each bracket subsequence is an object. Errors or unexpected results
    will happen otherwise. A convenient means to ensure the right depth is by
    including a length-0 tuple as a bracket and then truncating the object
    array to remove the placeholder. This can be seen in the following
    example:

    >>> bracket=np.array([(1.0, 1.2),(2.0, 2.5), ()], dtype=object)[:-1]
    >>> z_at_value(Planck18.angular_diameter_distance, 1500 * u.Mpc,
    ...            bracket=bracket)  # doctest: +SKIP
    <Quantity [0.68044452, 3.7823268] redshift>
