## When True, use ANSI color escape sequences when writing to the console.

### CORE DATA STRUCTURES AND TRANSFORMATIONS

[nddata]

## Whether to issue a warning if NDData arithmetic is performed with
## uncertainties and the uncertainties do not support the propagation of
## correlated uncertainties.
# warn_unsupported_correlated = True

## Whether to issue a warning when the `~astropy.nddata.NDData` unit
## attribute is changed from a non-``None`` value to another value
## that data values/uncertainties are not scaled with the unit change.
# warn_setting_unit_directly = True

[table]

## The template that determines the name of a column if it cannot be
## determined. Uses new-style (format method) string formatting
# auto_colname = col{0}

[table.jsviewer]

## The URL to the jQuery library to use.  If not provided, uses the
## internal copy installed with astropy.
# jquery_url =

## The URL to the jQuery datatables library to use.  If not provided,
## uses the internal copy installed with astropy.

### ASTRONOMY COMPUTATIONS AND UTILITIES

[samp]

## Whether to allow astropy.samp to use the internet, if available
# use_internet = True

## How many times to retry communications when they fail
# n_retries = 10


### INPUT/OUTPUT

[io.fits]

## If True, enable support for record-valued keywords as described by FITS WCS
## Paper IV. Otherwise they are treated as normal keywords.
# enable_record_valued_keyword_cards = True

## If True, extension names (i.e. the EXTNAME keyword) should be treated as
## case-sensitive.
# extension_name_case_sensitive = False

## If True, automatically remove trailing whitespace for string values in
## headers.  Otherwise the values are returned verbatim, with all whitespace
## intact.
# strip_header_whitespace = True

## If True, use memory-mapped file access to read/write the data in FITS files.
## This generally provides better performance, especially for large files, but
## may affect performance in I/O-heavy applications.
# use_memmap = True

[io.votable]

## When True, treat fixable violations of the VOTable spec as exceptions.
# pedantic = True

# log_warnings = True

## Whether to log exceptions before raising them
# log_exceptions = False
