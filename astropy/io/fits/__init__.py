"""
A package for reading and writing FITS files and manipulating their
contents.

A module for reading and writing Flexible Image Transport System
(FITS) files.  This file format was endorsed by the International
Astronomical Union in 1999 and mandated by NASA as the standard format
for storing high energy astrophysics data.  For details of the FITS
standard, see the NASA/Science Office of Standards and Technology
publication, NOST 100-2.0.
