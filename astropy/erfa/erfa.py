"""
This module uses Cython to wrap the ERFA library in numpy-vectorized
equivalents.

..warning::
    This is currently *not* part of the public Astropy API, and may change in
    the future.


The key idea is that any function can be called with inputs that are arrays,
and the wrappers will automatically vectorize and call the ERFA functions for
each item using broadcasting rules for numpy.  So the return values are always
numpy arrays of some sort.

For ERFA functions that take/return vectors or matricies, the vector/matrix
dimension(s) are always the *last* dimension(s).  For example, if you
want to give ten matricies (i.e., the ERFA input type is double[3][3]),
you would pass in a (10, 3, 3) numpy array.  If the output of the ERFA
function is scalar, you'll get back a length-10 1D array.

    1) The algorithm used is valid from -4800 March 1, but this

    2) The Julian Date is returned in two pieces, in the usual ERFA
       manner, which is designed to preserve time resolution.  The
       Julian Date is available as a single number by adding djm0 and
       djm.

    3) In early eras the conversion is from the "Proleptic Gregorian
       Calendar";  no account is taken of the date(s) of adoption of
       the Gregorian Calendar, nor is the AD/BC numbering convention
       observed.

    Notes:

    1) The algorithm is based on Expr. (7.40) in the Explanatory
       Supplement (Urban & Seidelmann 2013), but with the following
       changes:

       o  Rigorous rather than approximate normalization is applied.

       o  The gravitational potential term from Expr. (7) in
          Klioner (2003) is added, taking into account only the Sun's
          contribution.  This has a maximum effect of about
          0.4 microarcsecond.

    2) In almost all cases, the maximum accuracy will be limited by the
       supplied velocity.  For example, if the ERFA eraEpv00 function is
       used, errors of up to 5 microarcseconds could occur.

       The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in cases
       where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
       acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way the
       argument is handled internally and will deliver the optimum
       resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods are both
       good compromises between resolution and convenience.  For most
       applications of this function the choice will not be at all
       critical.

       TT can be used instead of TDB without any significant impact on
       accuracy.

    4) This is one of several functions that inserts into the astrom
       structure star-independent parameters needed for the chain of
       astrometric transformations ICRS <-> GCRS <-> CIRS <-> observed.

       The various functions support different classes of observer and

       Those with names ending in "13" use contemporary ERFA models to
       compute the various ephemerides.  The others accept ephemerides
       supplied by the caller.

       The transformation from ICRS to GCRS covers space motion,
       parallax, light deflection, and aberration.  From GCRS to CIRS
       comprises frame bias and precession-nutation.  From CIRS to
       observed takes account of Earth rotation, polar motion, diurnal
       aberration and parallax (unless subsumed into the ICRS <-> GCRS
       transformation), and atmospheric refraction.

       convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
       JD(TDB)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways, among
       others:

              date1          date2

    Notes:

    1) The TDB date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
       convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
       JD(TDB)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways, among
       others:

              date1          date2

           2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
           2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
           2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
           2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)

       The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in cases
       where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
       acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way the
       argument is handled internally and will deliver the optimum
       resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods are both
       good compromises between resolution and convenience.  For most
       applications of this function the choice will not be at all
       critical.

       TT can be used instead of TDB without any significant impact on
       accuracy.

    2) The vectors eb, eh, and all the astrom vectors, are with respect
       to BCRS axes.

    3) The geographical coordinates are with respect to the ERFA_WGS84
       reference ellipsoid.  TAKE CARE WITH THE LONGITUDE SIGN
       CONVENTION:  the longitude required by the present function is
       right-handed, i.e. east-positive, in accordance with geographical
       convention.

    4) xp and yp are the coordinates (in radians) of the Celestial
       Intermediate Pole with respect to the International Terrestrial
       Reference System (see IERS Conventions), measured along the
       meridians 0 and 90 deg west respectively.  sp is the TIO locator
       s', in radians, which positions the Terrestrial Intermediate
       Origin on the equator.  For many applications, xp, yp and
       (especially) sp can be set to zero.

       Internally, the polar motion is stored in a form rotated onto the
       local meridian.

    5) The refraction constants refa and refb are for use in a
       dZ = A*tan(Z)+B*tan^3(Z) model, where Z is the observed
       (i.e. refracted) zenith distance and dZ is the amount of
       refraction.

    6) It is advisable to take great care with units, as even unlikely
       values of the input parameters are accepted and processed in
       accordance with the models used.

    7) In cases where the caller does not wish to provide the Earth
       Ephemeris, the Earth rotation information and refraction
       constants, the function eraApco13 can be used instead of the
       present function.  This starts from UTC and weather readings etc.
       and computes suitable values using other ERFA functions.

        present function is that the JD day represents UTC days whether
        the length is 86399, 86400 or 86401 SI seconds.

        Applications should use the function eraDtf2d to convert from
        calendar date and time of day into 2-part quasi Julian Date, as
        it implements the leap-second-ambiguity convention just
        described.

    2)  The warning status "dubious year" flags UTCs that predate the
        introduction of the time scale or that are too far in the
        future to be trusted.  See eraDat for further details.

    3)  UT1-UTC is tabulated in IERS bulletins.  It increases by exactly
        one second at the end of each positive UTC leap second,
        introduced in order to keep UT1-UTC within +/- 0.9s.  n.b. This
        practice is under review, and in the future UT1-UTC may grow
        essentially without limit.

    4)  The geographical coordinates are with respect to the ERFA_WGS84
        reference ellipsoid.  TAKE CARE WITH THE LONGITUDE SIGN:  the
        longitude required by the present function is east-positive
        (i.e. right-handed), in accordance with geographical convention.

    5)  The polar motion xp,yp can be obtained from IERS bulletins.  The
        values are the coordinates (in radians) of the Celestial
        Intermediate Pole with respect to the International Terrestrial
        Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003), measured along the
        meridians 0 and 90 deg west respectively.  For many
        applications, xp and yp can be set to zero.

        Internally, the polar motion is stored in a form rotated onto
        the local meridian.

    6)  If hm, the height above the ellipsoid of the observing station
        in meters, is not known but phpa, the pressure in hPa (=mB), is
        available, an adequate estimate of hm can be obtained from the
        expression

              hm = -29.3 * tsl * log ( phpa / 1013.25 );

        where tsl is the approximate sea-level air temperature in K
        (See Astrophysical Quantities, C.W.Allen, 3rd edition, section
        52).  Similarly, if the pressure phpa is not known, it can be
        estimated from the height of the observing station, hm, as
        follows:

              phpa = 1013.25 * exp ( -hm / ( 29.3 * tsl ) );

        Note, however, that the refraction is nearly proportional to
        the pressure and that an accurate phpa value is important for
        precise work.

    7)  The argument wl specifies the observing wavelength in
        micrometers.  The transition from optical to radio is assumed to
        occur at 100 micrometers (about 3000 GHz).

    8)  It is advisable to take great care with units, as even unlikely
        values of the input parameters are accepted and processed in
        accordance with the models used.

    9)  In cases where the caller wishes to supply his own Earth
        ephemeris, Earth rotation information and refraction constants,
        the function eraApco can be used instead of the present function.

    10) This is one of several functions that inserts into the astrom
        structure star-independent parameters needed for the chain of
        astrometric transformations ICRS <-> GCRS <-> CIRS <-> observed.

        The various functions support different classes of observer and
        portions of the transformation chain:

        Those with names ending in "13" use contemporary ERFA models to
        compute the various ephemerides.  The others accept ephemerides
        supplied by the caller.

        The transformation from ICRS to GCRS covers space motion,
        parallax, light deflection, and aberration.  From GCRS to CIRS
        comprises frame bias and precession-nutation.  From CIRS to
        observed takes account of Earth rotation, polar motion, diurnal
        aberration and parallax (unless subsumed into the ICRS <-> GCRS
        transformation), and atmospheric refraction.

    Notes:

    1) The TDB date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
       convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
       JD(TDB)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways, among
       others:

              date1          date2

           2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
           2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
           2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
           2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)

       The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in cases
       where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
       acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way the
       argument is handled internally and will deliver the optimum
       resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods are both
       good compromises between resolution and convenience.  For most
       applications of this function the choice will not be at all
       critical.

       TT can be used instead of TDB without any significant impact on
       accuracy.

    2) All the vectors are with respect to BCRS axes.

    3) Providing separate arguments for (i) the observer's geocentric
       position and velocity and (ii) the Earth ephemeris is done for
       convenience in the geocentric, terrestrial and Earth orbit cases.
       For deep space applications it maybe more convenient to specify
       zero geocentric position and velocity and to supply the
       observer's position and velocity information directly instead of
       with respect to the Earth.  However, note the different units:
       m and m/s for the geocentric vectors, au and au/day for the
       heliocentric and barycentric vectors.

    4) In cases where the caller does not wish to provide the Earth
       ephemeris, the function eraApcs13 can be used instead of the
       present function.  This computes the Earth ephemeris using the
       ERFA function eraEpv00.

    Notes:

    1) This function exists to enable sidereal-tracking applications to

    2) For targets expressed as equinox based positions, such as

       Greenwich apparent sidereal time rather than Earth rotation

    Notes:

    1) The UT1 date (n.b. not UTC) ut11+ut12 is a Julian Date,
       apportioned in any convenient way between the arguments ut11 and
       ut12.  For example, JD(UT1)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any
       of these ways, among others:

              ut11           ut12

           2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
           2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
           2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
           2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)

       The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in cases
       where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
       acceptable.  The J2000 and MJD methods are good compromises
       between resolution and convenience.  The date & time method is
       best matched to the algorithm used:  maximum precision is
       delivered when the ut11 argument is for 0hrs UT1 on the day in
       question and the ut12 argument lies in the range 0 to 1, or vice
       versa.

    2) If the caller wishes to provide the Earth rotation angle itself,
       the function eraAper can be used instead.  One use of this
       technique is to substitute Greenwich apparent sidereal time and
       thereby to support equinox based transformations directly.

    3) This is one of several functions that inserts into the astrom
       structure star-independent parameters needed for the chain of
       astrometric transformations ICRS <-> GCRS <-> CIRS <-> observed.

       The various functions support different classes of observer and

    Notes:

    1) sp, the TIO locator s', is a tiny quantity needed only by the
       most precise applications.  It can either be set to zero or
       predicted using the ERFA function eraSp00.

    2) The geographical coordinates are with respect to the ERFA_WGS84
       reference ellipsoid.  TAKE CARE WITH THE LONGITUDE SIGN:  the
       longitude required by the present function is east-positive
       (i.e. right-handed), in accordance with geographical convention.

    3) The polar motion xp,yp can be obtained from IERS bulletins.  The
       values are the coordinates (in radians) of the Celestial
       Intermediate Pole with respect to the International Terrestrial
       Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003), measured along the
       meridians 0 and 90 deg west respectively.  For many applications,
       xp and yp can be set to zero.

       Internally, the polar motion is stored in a form rotated onto the
       local meridian.

    4) The refraction constants refa and refb are for use in a
       dZ = A*tan(Z)+B*tan^3(Z) model, where Z is the observed
       (i.e. refracted) zenith distance and dZ is the amount of
       refraction.

    5) It is advisable to take great care with units, as even unlikely
       values of the input parameters are accepted and processed in
       accordance with the models used.

    6) In cases where the caller does not wish to provide the Earth
       rotation information and refraction constants, the function
       eraApio13 can be used instead of the present function.  This
       starts from UTC and weather readings etc. and computes suitable
       values using other ERFA functions.

                                  -1 = unacceptable date

    Notes:

    1)  utc1+utc2 is quasi Julian Date (see Note 2), apportioned in any
        convenient way between the two arguments, for example where utc1
        is the Julian Day Number and utc2 is the fraction of a day.

        However, JD cannot unambiguously represent UTC during a leap
        second unless special measures are taken.  The convention in the
        present function is that the JD day represents UTC days whether
        the length is 86399, 86400 or 86401 SI seconds.

        Applications should use the function eraDtf2d to convert from
        calendar date and time of day into 2-part quasi Julian Date, as
        it implements the leap-second-ambiguity convention just
        described.

    2)  The warning status "dubious year" flags UTCs that predate the
        introduction of the time scale or that are too far in the future
        to be trusted.  See eraDat for further details.

    3)  UT1-UTC is tabulated in IERS bulletins.  It increases by exactly
        one second at the end of each positive UTC leap second,
        introduced in order to keep UT1-UTC within +/- 0.9s.  n.b. This
        practice is under review, and in the future UT1-UTC may grow
        essentially without limit.

    4)  The geographical coordinates are with respect to the ERFA_WGS84
        reference ellipsoid.  TAKE CARE WITH THE LONGITUDE SIGN:  the
        longitude required by the present function is east-positive
        (i.e. right-handed), in accordance with geographical convention.

    5)  The polar motion xp,yp can be obtained from IERS bulletins.  The
        values are the coordinates (in radians) of the Celestial
        Intermediate Pole with respect to the International Terrestrial
        Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003), measured along the
        meridians 0 and 90 deg west respectively.  For many applications,
        xp and yp can be set to zero.

        Internally, the polar motion is stored in a form rotated onto
        the local meridian.

    6)  If hm, the height above the ellipsoid of the observing station
        in meters, is not known but phpa, the pressure in hPa (=mB), is
        available, an adequate estimate of hm can be obtained from the
        expression

              hm = -29.3 * tsl * log ( phpa / 1013.25 );

        where tsl is the approximate sea-level air temperature in K
        (See Astrophysical Quantities, C.W.Allen, 3rd edition, section
        52).  Similarly, if the pressure phpa is not known, it can be
        estimated from the height of the observing station, hm, as
        follows:

              phpa = 1013.25 * exp ( -hm / ( 29.3 * tsl ) );

        Note, however, that the refraction is nearly proportional to the
        pressure and that an accurate phpa value is important for
        precise work.

    7)  The argument wl specifies the observing wavelength in
        micrometers.  The transition from optical to radio is assumed to
        occur at 100 micrometers (about 3000 GHz).

    8)  It is advisable to take great care with units, as even unlikely
        values of the input parameters are accepted and processed in
        accordance with the models used.

    9)  In cases where the caller wishes to supply his own Earth
        rotation information and refraction constants, the function
        eraApc can be used instead of the present function.

    10) This is one of several functions that inserts into the astrom

    Returned:
       ri,di  double*  CIRS geocentric RA,Dec (radians)
       eo     double*  equation of the origins (ERA-GST, Note 5)

    Notes:

    1) Star data for an epoch other than J2000.0 (for example from the
       Hipparcos catalog, which has an epoch of J1991.25) will require a
       preliminary call to eraPmsafe before use.

    2) The proper motion in RA is dRA/dt rather than cos(Dec)*dRA/dt.

    3) The TDB date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
       convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
       JD(TDB)=2450123.8g could be expressed in any of these ways, among
       others:

              date1          date2

           2450123.8g           0.0       (JD method)
           2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
           2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
           2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)

       The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in cases
       where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
       acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way the
       argument is handled internally and will deliver the optimum
       resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods are both
       good compromises between resolution and convenience.  For most
       applications of this function the choice will not be at all
       critical.

       TT can be used instead of TDB without any significant impact on
       accuracy.

    4) The available accuracy is better than 1 milliarcsecond, limited
       mainly by the precession-nutation model that is used, namely
       IAU 2000A/2006.  Very close to solar system bodies, additional
       errors of up to several milliarcseconds can occur because of
       unmodeled light deflection;  however, the Sun's contribution is
       taken into account, to first order.  The accuracy limitations of
       the ERFA function eraEpv00 (used to compute Earth position and
       velocity) can contribute aberration errors of up to
       5 microarcseconds.  Light deflection at the Sun's limb is
       uncertain at the 0.4 mas level.

    5) Should the transformation to (equinox based) apparent place be
       required rather than (CIO based) intermediate place, subtract the
       equation of the origins from the returned right ascension:
       RA = RI - EO. (The eraAnp function can then be applied, as
       required, to keep the result in the conventional 0-2pi range.)

    Notes:

    1) Star data for an epoch other than J2000.0 (for example from the
       Hipparcos catalog, which has an epoch of J1991.25) will require a
       preliminary call to eraPmsafe before use.

    2) The proper motion in RA is dRA/dt rather than cos(Dec)*dRA/dt.

    3) The struct b contains n entries, one for each body to be
       considered.  If n = 0, no gravitational light deflection will be
       applied, not even for the Sun.

    4) The struct b should include an entry for the Sun as well as for
       any planet or other body to be taken into account.  The entries
       should be in the order in which the light passes the body.

    5) In the entry in the b struct for body i, the mass parameter
       b[i].bm can, as required, be adjusted in order to allow for such
       effects as quadrupole field.

    6) The deflection limiter parameter b[i].dl is phi^2/2, where phi is
       the angular separation (in radians) between star and body at
       which limiting is applied.  As phi shrinks below the chosen
       threshold, the deflection is artificially reduced, reaching zero
       for phi = 0.   Example values suitable for a terrestrial
       observer, together with masses, are as follows:

          body i     b[i].bm        b[i].dl

          Sun        1.0            6e-6
          Jupiter    0.00095435     3e-9
          Saturn     0.00028574     3e-10

    7) For efficiency, validation of the contents of the b array is
       omitted.  The supplied masses must be greater than zero, the
       position and velocity vectors must be right, and the deflection
       limiter greater than zero.

                               -1 = unacceptable date

    Notes:

    1)  Star data for an epoch other than J2000.0 (for example from the
        Hipparcos catalog, which has an epoch of J1991.25) will require
        a preliminary call to eraPmsafe before use.

    2)  The proper motion in RA is dRA/dt rather than cos(Dec)*dRA/dt.

    3)  utc1+utc2 is quasi Julian Date (see Note 2), apportioned in any
        convenient way between the two arguments, for example where utc1
        is the Julian Day Number and utc2 is the fraction of a day.

        However, JD cannot unambiguously represent UTC during a leap
        second unless special measures are taken.  The convention in the
        present function is that the JD day represents UTC days whether
        the length is 86399, 86400 or 86401 SI seconds.

        Applications should use the function eraDtf2d to convert from
        calendar date and time of day into 2-part quasi Julian Date, as
        it implements the leap-second-ambiguity convention just
        described.

    4)  The warning status "dubious year" flags UTCs that predate the
        introduction of the time scale or that are too far in the
        future to be trusted.  See eraDat for further details.

    5)  UT1-UTC is tabulated in IERS bulletins.  It increases by exactly
        one second at the end of each positive UTC leap second,
        introduced in order to keep UT1-UTC within +/- 0.9s.  n.b. This
        practice is under review, and in the future UT1-UTC may grow
        essentially without limit.

    6)  The geographical coordinates are with respect to the ERFA_WGS84
        reference ellipsoid.  TAKE CARE WITH THE LONGITUDE SIGN:  the
        longitude required by the present function is east-positive
        (i.e. right-handed), in accordance with geographical convention.

    7)  The polar motion xp,yp can be obtained from IERS bulletins.  The
        values are the coordinates (in radians) of the Celestial
        Intermediate Pole with respect to the International Terrestrial
        Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003), measured along the
        meridians 0 and 90 deg west respectively.  For many
        applications, xp and yp can be set to zero.

    8)  If hm, the height above the ellipsoid of the observing station
        in meters, is not known but phpa, the pressure in hPa (=mB),
        is available, an adequate estimate of hm can be obtained from
        the expression

              hm = -29.3 * tsl * log ( phpa / 1013.25 );

        where tsl is the approximate sea-level air temperature in K
        (See Astrophysical Quantities, C.W.Allen, 3rd edition, section
        52).  Similarly, if the pressure phpa is not known, it can be
        estimated from the height of the observing station, hm, as
        follows:

              phpa = 1013.25 * exp ( -hm / ( 29.3 * tsl ) );

        Note, however, that the refraction is nearly proportional to
        the pressure and that an accurate phpa value is important for
        precise work.

    9)  The argument wl specifies the observing wavelength in
        micrometers.  The transition from optical to radio is assumed to
        occur at 100 micrometers (about 3000 GHz).

    10) The accuracy of the result is limited by the corrections for
        refraction, which use a simple A*tan(z) + B*tan^3(z) model.
        Providing the meteorological parameters are known accurately and
        there are no gross local effects, the predicted observed
        coordinates should be within 0.05 arcsec (optical) or 1 arcsec
        (radio) for a zenith distance of less than 70 degrees, better
        than 30 arcsec (optical or radio) at 85 degrees and better
        than 20 arcmin (optical) or 30 arcmin (radio) at the horizon.

        Without refraction, the complementary functions eraAtco13 and
        eraAtoc13 are self-consistent to better than 1 microarcsecond
        all over the celestial sphere.  With refraction included,
        consistency falls off at high zenith distances, but is still
        better than 0.05 arcsec at 85 degrees.

    11) "Observed" Az,ZD means the position that would be seen by a
        perfect geodetically aligned theodolite.  (Zenith distance is
        used rather than altitude in order to reflect the fact that no
        allowance is made for depression of the horizon.)  This is
        related to the observed HA,Dec via the standard rotation, using
        the geodetic latitude (corrected for polar motion), while the
        observed HA and RA are related simply through the Earth rotation
        angle and the site longitude.  "Observed" RA,Dec or HA,Dec thus
        means the position that would be seen by a perfect equatorial
        with its polar axis aligned to the Earth's axis of rotation.

    12) It is advisable to take great care with units, as even unlikely
        values of the input parameters are accepted and processed in
        accordance with the models used.

    Returned:
       rc,dc  double  ICRS astrometric RA,Dec (radians)
       eo     double  equation of the origins (ERA-GST, Note 4)

    Notes:

    1) The TDB date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
       convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
       JD(TDB)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways, among
       others:

              date1          date2

           2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
           2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
           2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
           2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)

       The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in cases
       where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
       acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way the
       argument is handled internally and will deliver the optimum
       resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods are both
       good compromises between resolution and convenience.  For most
       applications of this function the choice will not be at all
       critical.

       TT can be used instead of TDB without any significant impact on
       accuracy.

    2) Iterative techniques are used for the aberration and light
       deflection corrections so that the functions eraAtic13 (or
       eraAticq) and eraAtci13 (or eraAtciq) are accurate inverses;
       even at the edge of the Sun's disk the discrepancy is only about
       1 nanoarcsecond.

    3) The available accuracy is better than 1 milliarcsecond, limited
       mainly by the precession-nutation model that is used, namely
       IAU 2000A/2006.  Very close to solar system bodies, additional
       errors of up to several milliarcseconds can occur because of
       unmodeled light deflection;  however, the Sun's contribution is
       taken into account, to first order.  The accuracy limitations of
       the ERFA function eraEpv00 (used to compute Earth position and
       velocity) can contribute aberration errors of up to
       5 microarcseconds.  Light deflection at the Sun's limb is
       uncertain at the 0.4 mas level.

    4) Should the transformation to (equinox based) J2000.0 mean place
       be required rather than (CIO based) ICRS coordinates, subtract the
       equation of the origins from the returned right ascension:
       RA = RI - EO.  (The eraAnp function can then be applied, as
       required, to keep the result in the conventional 0-2pi range.)

    Notes:

    1) Iterative techniques are used for the aberration and light
       deflection corrections so that the functions eraAticqn and
       eraAtciqn are accurate inverses; even at the edge of the Sun's
       disk the discrepancy is only about 1 nanoarcsecond.

    2) If the only light-deflecting body to be taken into account is the
       Sun, the eraAticq function can be used instead.

    3) The struct b contains n entries, one for each body to be
       considered.  If n = 0, no gravitational light deflection will be
       applied, not even for the Sun.

    4) The struct b should include an entry for the Sun as well as for
       any planet or other body to be taken into account.  The entries
       should be in the order in which the light passes the body.

    5) In the entry in the b struct for body i, the mass parameter
       b[i].bm can, as required, be adjusted in order to allow for such
       effects as quadrupole field.

    6) The deflection limiter parameter b[i].dl is phi^2/2, where phi is
       the angular separation (in radians) between star and body at
       which limiting is applied.  As phi shrinks below the chosen
       threshold, the deflection is artificially reduced, reaching zero
       for phi = 0.   Example values suitable for a terrestrial
       observer, together with masses, are as follows:

          body i     b[i].bm        b[i].dl

          Sun        1.0            6e-6
          Jupiter    0.00095435     3e-9
          Saturn     0.00028574     3e-10

    7) For efficiency, validation of the contents of the b array is
       omitted.  The supplied masses must be greater than zero, the
       position and velocity vectors must be right, and the deflection
       limiter greater than zero.

                               -1 = unacceptable date

    Notes:

    1)  utc1+utc2 is quasi Julian Date (see Note 2), apportioned in any
        convenient way between the two arguments, for example where utc1
        is the Julian Day Number and utc2 is the fraction of a day.

        However, JD cannot unambiguously represent UTC during a leap
        second unless special measures are taken.  The convention in the
        present function is that the JD day represents UTC days whether
        the length is 86399, 86400 or 86401 SI seconds.

        Applications should use the function eraDtf2d to convert from
        calendar date and time of day into 2-part quasi Julian Date, as
        it implements the leap-second-ambiguity convention just
        described.

    2)  The warning status "dubious year" flags UTCs that predate the
        introduction of the time scale or that are too far in the
        future to be trusted.  See eraDat for further details.

    3)  UT1-UTC is tabulated in IERS bulletins.  It increases by exactly
        one second at the end of each positive UTC leap second,
        introduced in order to keep UT1-UTC within +/- 0.9s.  n.b. This
        practice is under review, and in the future UT1-UTC may grow
        essentially without limit.

    4)  The geographical coordinates are with respect to the ERFA_WGS84
        reference ellipsoid.  TAKE CARE WITH THE LONGITUDE SIGN:  the
        longitude required by the present function is east-positive
        (i.e. right-handed), in accordance with geographical convention.

    5)  The polar motion xp,yp can be obtained from IERS bulletins.  The
        values are the coordinates (in radians) of the Celestial
        Intermediate Pole with respect to the International Terrestrial
        Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003), measured along the
        meridians 0 and 90 deg west respectively.  For many
        applications, xp and yp can be set to zero.

    6)  If hm, the height above the ellipsoid of the observing station
        in meters, is not known but phpa, the pressure in hPa (=mB), is
        available, an adequate estimate of hm can be obtained from the
        expression

              hm = -29.3 * tsl * log ( phpa / 1013.25 );

        where tsl is the approximate sea-level air temperature in K
        (See Astrophysical Quantities, C.W.Allen, 3rd edition, section
        52).  Similarly, if the pressure phpa is not known, it can be
        estimated from the height of the observing station, hm, as
        follows:

              phpa = 1013.25 * exp ( -hm / ( 29.3 * tsl ) );

        Note, however, that the refraction is nearly proportional to
        the pressure and that an accurate phpa value is important for
        precise work.

    7)  The argument wl specifies the observing wavelength in
        micrometers.  The transition from optical to radio is assumed to
        occur at 100 micrometers (about 3000 GHz).

    8)  "Observed" Az,ZD means the position that would be seen by a
        perfect geodetically aligned theodolite.  (Zenith distance is
        used rather than altitude in order to reflect the fact that no
        allowance is made for depression of the horizon.)  This is
        related to the observed HA,Dec via the standard rotation, using
        the geodetic latitude (corrected for polar motion), while the
        observed HA and RA are related simply through the Earth rotation
        angle and the site longitude.  "Observed" RA,Dec or HA,Dec thus
        means the position that would be seen by a perfect equatorial
        with its polar axis aligned to the Earth's axis of rotation.

    9)  The accuracy of the result is limited by the corrections for
        refraction, which use a simple A*tan(z) + B*tan^3(z) model.
        Providing the meteorological parameters are known accurately and
        there are no gross local effects, the predicted astrometric
        coordinates should be within 0.05 arcsec (optical) or 1 arcsec
        (radio) for a zenith distance of less than 70 degrees, better
        than 30 arcsec (optical or radio) at 85 degrees and better
        than 20 arcmin (optical) or 30 arcmin (radio) at the horizon.

    10) The complementary functions eraAtio13 and eraAtoi13 are self-
        consistent to better than 1 microarcsecond all over the
        celestial sphere.

    11) It is advisable to take great care with units, as even unlikely
        values of the input parameters are accepted and processed in
        accordance with the models used.

    Notes:

    1) This function returns zenith distance rather than altitude in
       order to reflect the fact that no allowance is made for
       depression of the horizon.

    2) The accuracy of the result is limited by the corrections for
       refraction, which use a simple A*tan(z) + B*tan^3(z) model.
       Providing the meteorological parameters are known accurately and

       than 20 arcmin (optical) or 30 arcmin (radio) at the horizon.

       Without refraction, the complementary functions eraAtioq and
       eraAtoiq are self-consistent to better than 1 microarcsecond all
       over the celestial sphere.  With refraction included, consistency
       falls off at high zenith distances, but is still better than
       0.05 arcsec at 85 degrees.

    3) It is advisable to take great care with units, as even unlikely
       values of the input parameters are accepted and processed in
       accordance with the models used.

    4) The CIRS RA,Dec is obtained from a star catalog mean place by
       allowing for space motion, parallax, the Sun's gravitational lens
       effect, annual aberration and precession-nutation.  For star
       positions in the ICRS, these effects can be applied by means of
       the eraAtci13 (etc.) functions.  Starting from classical "mean
       place" systems, additional transformations will be needed first.

    5) "Observed" Az,El means the position that would be seen by a
       perfect geodetically aligned theodolite.  This is obtained from
       the CIRS RA,Dec by allowing for Earth orientation and diurnal
       aberration, rotating from equator to horizon coordinates, and
       then adjusting for refraction.  The HA,Dec is obtained by
       rotating back into equatorial coordinates, and is the position
       that would be seen by a perfect equatorial with its polar axis
       aligned to the Earth's axis of rotation.  Finally, the RA is
       obtained by subtracting the HA from the local ERA.

    6) The star-independent CIRS-to-observed-place parameters in ASTROM
       may be computed with eraApio[13] or eraApco[13].  If nothing has
       changed significantly except the time, eraAper[13] may be used to
       perform the requisite adjustment to the astrom structure.

    2)  Only the first character of the type argument is significant.
        "R" or "r" indicates that ob1 and ob2 are the observed right
        ascension and declination;  "H" or "h" indicates that they are
        hour angle (west +ve) and declination;  anything else ("A" or
        "a" is recommended) indicates that ob1 and ob2 are azimuth
        (north zero, east 90 deg) and zenith distance.

    Notes:

    1)  "Observed" Az,ZD means the position that would be seen by a
        perfect geodetically aligned theodolite.  (Zenith distance is
        used rather than altitude in order to reflect the fact that no
        allowance is made for depression of the horizon.)  This is
        related to the observed HA,Dec via the standard rotation, using
        the geodetic latitude (corrected for polar motion), while the
        observed HA and RA are related simply through the Earth rotation
        angle and the site longitude.  "Observed" RA,Dec or HA,Dec thus
        means the position that would be seen by a perfect equatorial
        with its polar axis aligned to the Earth's axis of rotation.

    2)  Only the first character of the type argument is significant.
        "R" or "r" indicates that ob1 and ob2 are the observed right
        ascension and declination;  "H" or "h" indicates that they are
        hour angle (west +ve) and declination;  anything else ("A" or
        "a" is recommended) indicates that ob1 and ob2 are azimuth
        (north zero, east 90 deg) and zenith distance.

    3)  utc1+utc2 is quasi Julian Date (see Note 2), apportioned in any
        convenient way between the two arguments, for example where utc1
        is the Julian Day Number and utc2 is the fraction of a day.

        However, JD cannot unambiguously represent UTC during a leap
        second unless special measures are taken.  The convention in the
        present function is that the JD day represents UTC days whether
        the length is 86399, 86400 or 86401 SI seconds.

        Applications should use the function eraDtf2d to convert from
        calendar date and time of day into 2-part quasi Julian Date, as
        it implements the leap-second-ambiguity convention just
        described.

    4)  The warning status "dubious year" flags UTCs that predate the
        introduction of the time scale or that are too far in the
        future to be trusted.  See eraDat for further details.

    5)  UT1-UTC is tabulated in IERS bulletins.  It increases by exactly
        one second at the end of each positive UTC leap second,
        introduced in order to keep UT1-UTC within +/- 0.9s.  n.b. This
        practice is under review, and in the future UT1-UTC may grow
        essentially without limit.

    6)  The geographical coordinates are with respect to the ERFA_WGS84
        reference ellipsoid.  TAKE CARE WITH THE LONGITUDE SIGN:  the
        longitude required by the present function is east-positive
        (i.e. right-handed), in accordance with geographical convention.

    7)  The polar motion xp,yp can be obtained from IERS bulletins.  The
        values are the coordinates (in radians) of the Celestial
        Intermediate Pole with respect to the International Terrestrial
        Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003), measured along the
        meridians 0 and 90 deg west respectively.  For many
        applications, xp and yp can be set to zero.

    8)  If hm, the height above the ellipsoid of the observing station
        in meters, is not known but phpa, the pressure in hPa (=mB), is
        available, an adequate estimate of hm can be obtained from the
        expression

              hm = -29.3 * tsl * log ( phpa / 1013.25 );

        where tsl is the approximate sea-level air temperature in K
        (See Astrophysical Quantities, C.W.Allen, 3rd edition, section
        52).  Similarly, if the pressure phpa is not known, it can be
        estimated from the height of the observing station, hm, as
        follows:

              phpa = 1013.25 * exp ( -hm / ( 29.3 * tsl ) );

        Note, however, that the refraction is nearly proportional to
        the pressure and that an accurate phpa value is important for
        precise work.

    9)  The argument wl specifies the observing wavelength in
        micrometers.  The transition from optical to radio is assumed to
        occur at 100 micrometers (about 3000 GHz).

    10) The accuracy of the result is limited by the corrections for
        refraction, which use a simple A*tan(z) + B*tan^3(z) model.
        Providing the meteorological parameters are known accurately and
        there are no gross local effects, the predicted astrometric
        coordinates should be within 0.05 arcsec (optical) or 1 arcsec
        (radio) for a zenith distance of less than 70 degrees, better
        than 30 arcsec (optical or radio) at 85 degrees and better
        than 20 arcmin (optical) or 30 arcmin (radio) at the horizon.

        Without refraction, the complementary functions eraAtio13 and
        eraAtoi13 are self-consistent to better than 1 microarcsecond
        all over the celestial sphere.  With refraction included,
        consistency falls off at high zenith distances, but is still
        better than 0.05 arcsec at 85 degrees.

    12) It is advisable to take great care with units, as even unlikely
        values of the input parameters are accepted and processed in
        accordance with the models used.

    Returned:

    Notes:

    1) The algorithm is based on Expr. (70) in Klioner (2003) and
       Expr. (7.63) in the Explanatory Supplement (Urban & Seidelmann
       2013), with some rearrangement to minimize the effects of machine
       precision.

    2) The mass parameter bm can, as required, be adjusted in order to
       allow for such effects as quadrupole field.

    3) The barycentric position of the deflecting body should ideally
       correspond to the time of closest approach of the light ray to
       the body.

    4) The deflection limiter parameter dlim is phi^2/2, where phi is
       the angular separation (in radians) between source and body at
       which limiting is applied.  As phi shrinks below the chosen
       threshold, the deflection is artificially reduced, reaching zero
       for phi = 0.

    5) The returned vector p1 is not normalized, but the consequential
       departure from unit magnitude is always negligible.

    6) The arguments p and p1 can be the same array.

    7) To accumulate total light deflection taking into account the
       contributions from several bodies, call the present function for
       each body in succession, in decreasing order of distance from the
       observer.

    8) For efficiency, validation is omitted.  The supplied vectors must
       be of unit magnitude, and the deflection limiter non-zero and
       positive.

    1) The array b contains n entries, one for each body to be
       considered.  If n = 0, no gravitational light deflection will be
       applied, not even for the Sun.

    2) The array b should include an entry for the Sun as well as for
       any planet or other body to be taken into account.  The entries
       should be in the order in which the light passes the body.

    3) In the entry in the b array for body i, the mass parameter
       b[i].bm can, as required, be adjusted in order to allow for such
       effects as quadrupole field.

    4) The deflection limiter parameter b[i].dl is phi^2/2, where phi is
       the angular separation (in radians) between star and body at
       which limiting is applied.  As phi shrinks below the chosen
       threshold, the deflection is artificially reduced, reaching zero
       for phi = 0.   Example values suitable for a terrestrial
       observer, together with masses, are as follows:

          body i     b[i].bm        b[i].dl

          Saturn     0.00028574     3e-10

    5) For cases where the starlight passes the body before reaching the
       observer, the body is placed back along its barycentric track by
       the light time from that point to the observer.  For cases where
       the body is "behind" the observer no such shift is applied.  If
       a different treatment is preferred, the user has the option of
       instead using the eraLd function.  Similarly, eraLd can be used
       for cases where the source is nearby, not a star.

    6) The returned vector sn is not normalized, but the consequential
       departure from unit magnitude is always negligible.

    7) The arguments sc and sn can be the same array.

    8) For efficiency, validation is omitted.  The supplied masses must
       be greater than zero, the position and velocity vectors must be
       right, and the deflection limiter greater than zero.

    Notes:

    1) The proper motion in RA is dRA/dt rather than cos(Dec)*dRA/dt.

    2) The proper motion time interval is for when the starlight
       reaches the solar system barycenter.

    3) To avoid the need for iteration, the Roemer effect (i.e. the
       small annual modulation of the proper motion coming from the
       changing light time) is applied approximately, using the
       direction of the star at the catalog epoch.

    Notes:

    1) The starting and ending TDB epochs ep1a+ep1b and ep2a+ep2b are
       Julian Dates, apportioned in any convenient way between the two
       parts (A and B).  For example, JD(TDB)=2450123.7 could be
       expressed in any of these ways, among others:

              epNa            epNb

           2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
           2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
           2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
           2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)

       The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in cases
       where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
       acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way the
       argument is handled internally and will deliver the optimum
       resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods are both
       good compromises between resolution and convenience.

    2) In accordance with normal star-catalog conventions, the object's
       right ascension and declination are freed from the effects of
       secular aberration.  The frame, which is aligned to the catalog
       equator and equinox, is Lorentzian and centered on the SSB.

       The proper motions are the rate of change of the right ascension
       and declination at the catalog epoch and are in radians per TDB
       Julian year.

       The parallax and radial velocity are in the same frame.

    3) Care is needed with units.  The star coordinates are in radians
       and the proper motions in radians per Julian year, but the
       parallax is in arcseconds.

    4) The RA proper motion is in terms of coordinate angle, not true
       angle.  If the catalog uses arcseconds for both RA and Dec proper
       motions, the RA proper motion will need to be divided by cos(Dec)
       before use.

    5) Straight-line motion at constant speed, in the inertial frame, is
       assumed.

    6) An extremely small (or zero or negative) parallax is overridden
       to ensure that the object is at a finite but very large distance,
       but not so large that the proper motion is equivalent to a large
       but safe speed (about 0.1c using the chosen constant).  A warning
       status of 1 is added to the status if this action has been taken.

    7) If the space velocity is a significant fraction of c (see the
       constant VMAX in the function eraStarpv), it is arbitrarily set
       to zero.  When this action occurs, 2 is added to the status.

    8) The relativistic adjustment carried out in the eraStarpv function
       involves an iterative calculation.  If the process fails to
       converge within a set number of iterations, 4 is added to the
       status.

    Notes:

    1) The model balances speed and accuracy to give good results in
       applications where performance at low altitudes is not paramount.
       Performance is maintained across a range of conditions, and
       applies to both optical/IR and radio.

    2) The model omits the effects of (i) height above sea level (apart
       from the reduced pressure itself), (ii) latitude (i.e. the
       flattening of the Earth), (iii) variations in tropospheric lapse
       rate and (iv) dispersive effects in the radio.

       The model was tested using the following range of conditions:

         lapse rates 0.0055, 0.0065, 0.0075 deg/meter
         latitudes 0, 25, 50, 75 degrees
         heights 0, 2500, 5000 meters ASL
         pressures mean for height -10% to +5% in steps of 5%
         temperatures -10 deg to +20 deg with respect to 280 deg at SL
         relative humidity 0, 0.5, 1
         wavelengths 0.4, 0.6, ... 2 micron, + radio
         zenith distances 15, 45, 75 degrees

       The accuracy with respect to raytracing through a model
       atmosphere was as follows:

                              worst         RMS

         optical/IR           62 mas       8 mas
         radio               319 mas      49 mas

       For this particular set of conditions:

         lapse rate 0.0065 K/meter
         latitude 50 degrees
         sea level
         pressure 1005 mb
         temperature 280.15 K

       The values for Saastamoinen's formula (which includes terms
       up to tan^5) are taken from Hohenkerk and Sinclair (1985).

    3) A wl value in the range 0-100 selects the optical/IR case and is
       wavelength in micrometers.  Any value outside this range selects
       the radio case.

    4) Outlandish input parameters are silently limited to
       mathematically safe values.  Zero pressure is permissible, and
       causes zeroes to be returned.

    5) The algorithm draws on several sources, as follows:

       a) The formula for the saturation vapour pressure of water as
          a function of temperature and temperature is taken from
          Equations (A4.5-A4.7) of Gill (1982).

       b) The formula for the water vapour pressure, given the
          saturation pressure and the relative humidity, is from
          Crane (1976), Equation (2.5.5).

       c) The refractivity of air is a function of temperature,
          total pressure, water-vapour pressure and, in the case
          of optical/IR, wavelength.  The formulae for the two cases are
          developed from Hohenkerk & Sinclair (1985) and Rueger (2002).

       d) The formula for beta, the ratio of the scale height of the
          atmosphere to the geocentric distance of the observer, is
          an adaption of Equation (9) from Stone (1996).  The
          adaptations, arrived at empirically, consist of (i) a small
          adjustment to the coefficient and (ii) a humidity term for the
          radio case only.

       e) The formulae for the refraction constants as a function of
          n-1 and beta are from Green (1987), Equation (4.31).

    Notes:

    1) The TDB date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
       convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
       JD(TDB)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways, among
       others:

              date1          date2

           2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)

           2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)

       The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in cases
       where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
       acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way the
       argument is handled internally and will deliver the optimum
       resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods are both
       good compromises between resolution and convenience.  However,
       the accuracy of the result is more likely to be limited by the
       algorithm itself than the way the date has been expressed.

       n.b. TT can be used instead of TDB in most applications.

    2) On return, the arrays pvh and pvb contain the following:

          pvh[0][0]  x       }
          pvh[0][1]  y       } heliocentric position, AU
          pvh[0][2]  z       }

          pvb[0][0]  x       }

          pvb[1][1]  ydot    } barycentric velocity, AU/d
          pvb[1][2]  zdot    }

       The vectors are with respect to the Barycentric Celestial
       Reference System.  The time unit is one day in TDB.

    3) The function is a SIMPLIFIED SOLUTION from the planetary theory
       VSOP2000 (X. Moisson, P. Bretagnon, 2001, Celes. Mechanics &
       Dyn. Astron., 80, 3/4, 205-213) and is an adaptation of original
       Fortran code supplied by P. Bretagnon (private comm., 2000).

    4) Comparisons over the time span 1900-2100 with this simplified
       solution and the JPL DE405 ephemeris give the following results:

                                  RMS    max
             Heliocentric:
                position error    3.7   11.2   km
                velocity error    1.4    5.0   mm/s

             Barycentric:
                position error    4.6   13.4   km
                velocity error    1.4    4.9   mm/s

       Comparisons with the JPL DE406 ephemeris show that by 1800 and
       2200 the position errors are approximately double their 1900-2100
       size.  By 1500 and 2500 the deterioration is a factor of 10 and

    Approximate heliocentric position and velocity of a nominated major

       np     int          planet (1=Mercury, 2=Venus, 3=EMB, 4=Mars,

    Returned (argument):
       pv     double[2][3] planet p,v (heliocentric, J2000.0, AU,AU/d)

    Returned (function value):
              int          status: -1 = illegal NP (outside 1-8)
                                    0 = OK

                                   +2 = warning: failed to converge

    Notes:

    1) The date date1+date2 is in the TDB time scale (in practice TT can
       be used) and is a Julian Date, apportioned in any convenient way
       between the two arguments.  For example, JD(TDB)=2450123.7 could
       be expressed in any of these ways, among others:

              date1          date2

           2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
           2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
           2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
           2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)

       The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in cases
       where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
       acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way the
       argument is handled internally and will deliver the optimum
       resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods are both
       good compromises between resolution and convenience.  The limited
       accuracy of the present algorithm is such that any of the methods
       is satisfactory.

    2) If an np value outside the range 1-8 is supplied, an error status
       (function value -1) is returned and the pv vector set to zeroes.

    3) For np=3 the result is for the Earth-Moon Barycenter.  To obtain
       the heliocentric position and velocity of the Earth, use instead
       the ERFA function eraEpv00.

    4) On successful return, the array pv contains the following:

          pv[0][0]   x      }
          pv[0][1]   y      } heliocentric position, AU
          pv[0][2]   z      }

          pv[1][0]   xdot   }
          pv[1][1]   ydot   } heliocentric velocity, AU/d
          pv[1][2]   zdot   }

       The reference frame is equatorial and is with respect to the
       mean equator and equinox of epoch J2000.0.

    5) The algorithm is due to J.L. Simon, P. Bretagnon, J. Chapront,
       M. Chapront-Touze, G. Francou and J. Laskar (Bureau des
       Longitudes, Paris, France).  From comparisons with JPL
       ephemeris DE102, they quote the following maximum errors
       over the interval 1800-2050:

                       L (arcsec)    B (arcsec)      R (km)

          Mercury          4             1             300
          Venus            5             1             800
          EMB              6             1            1000
          Mars            17             1            7700
          Jupiter         71             5           76000
          Saturn          81            13          267000
          Uranus          86             7          712000
          Neptune         11             1          253000

       Over the interval 1000-3000, they report that the accuracy is no
       worse than 1.5 times that over 1800-2050.  Outside 1000-3000 the
       accuracy declines.

       Comparisons of the present function with the JPL DE200 ephemeris
       give the following RMS errors over the interval 1960-2025:

                        position (km)     velocity (m/s)

          Mercury            334               0.437
          Venus             1060               0.855
          EMB               2010               0.815
          Mars              7690               1.98
          Jupiter          71700               7.70
          Saturn          199000              19.4
          Uranus          564000              16.4
          Neptune         158000              14.4

       Comparisons against DE200 over the interval 1800-2100 gave the
       following maximum absolute differences.  (The results using
       DE406 were essentially the same.)

                     L (arcsec)   B (arcsec)     R (km)   Rdot (m/s)

          Mercury        7            1            500       0.7
          Venus          7            1           1100       0.9
          EMB            9            1           1300       1.0
          Mars          26            1           9000       2.5
          Jupiter       78            6          82000       8.2
          Saturn        87           14         263000      24.6
          Uranus        86            7         661000      27.4
          Neptune       11            2         248000      21.4

    6) The present ERFA re-implementation of the original Simon et al.
       Fortran code differs from the original in the following respects:

         *  C instead of Fortran.

         *  The date is supplied in two parts.

         *  The result is returned only in equatorial Cartesian form;
            the ecliptic longitude, latitude and radius vector are not
            returned.

         *  The result is in the J2000.0 equatorial frame, not ecliptic.

         *  More is done in-line: there are fewer calls to subroutines.

         *  Different error/warning status values are used.

         *  A different Kepler's-equation-solver is used (avoiding
            use of double precision complex).

         *  Polynomials in t are nested to minimize rounding errors.

         *  Explicit double constants are used to avoid mixed-mode
            expressions.

       None of the above changes affects the result significantly.

    7) The returned status indicates the most serious condition
       encountered during execution of the function.  Illegal np is
       considered the most serious, overriding failure to converge,
       which in turn takes precedence over the remote date warning.

    Notes:

    1) The frame bias corrections in longitude and obliquity (radians)
       are required in order to correct for the offset between the GCRS
       pole and the mean J2000.0 pole.  They define, with respect to the
       GCRS frame, a J2000.0 mean pole that is consistent with the rest
       of the IAU 2000A precession-nutation model.

    2) In addition to the displacement of the pole, the complete
       description of the frame bias requires also an offset in right
       ascension.  This is not part of the IAU 2000A model, and is from
       Chapront et al. (2002).  It is returned in radians.

    3) This is a supplemented implementation of one aspect of the IAU
       2000A nutation model, formally adopted by the IAU General
       Assembly in 2000, namely MHB2000 (Mathews et al. 2002).

       rbp          double[3][3]   bias-precession matrix (Note 4)

    Notes:

    1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
       convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
       JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
       among others:

               date1         date2

           2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
           2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
           2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
           2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)

       The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
       cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
       is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
       the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
       optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
       are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.

    2) The matrix rb transforms vectors from GCRS to mean J2000.0 by
       applying frame bias.

    3) The matrix rp transforms vectors from J2000.0 mean equator and
       equinox to mean equator and equinox of date by applying
       precession.

    4) The matrix rbp transforms vectors from GCRS to mean equator and
       equinox of date by applying frame bias then precession.  It is
       the product rp x rb.

    5) It is permissible to re-use the same array in the returned
       arguments.  The arrays are filled in the order given.

    Frame bias and precession, IAU 2006.

    Given:
       date1,date2  double         TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)

    Returned:
       rb           double[3][3]   frame bias matrix (Note 2)

       rbp          double[3][3]   bias-precession matrix (Note 4)

    Notes:

    1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
       convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
       JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
       among others:

               date1         date2

           2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
           2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
           2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
           2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)

       The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
       cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
       is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
       the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
       optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
       are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.

    2) The matrix rb transforms vectors from GCRS to mean J2000.0 by
       applying frame bias.

    3) The matrix rp transforms vectors from mean J2000.0 to mean of
       date by applying precession.

    4) The matrix rbp transforms vectors from GCRS to mean of date by
       applying frame bias then precession.  It is the product rp x rb.

    5) It is permissible to re-use the same array in the returned
       arguments.  The arrays are filled in the order given.

    date when the CIP X,Y coordinates are known.  IAU 2000.

    Given:
       date1,date2 double       TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
       x,y         double       Celestial Intermediate Pole (Note 2)

    Returned:
       rc2i        double[3][3] celestial-to-intermediate matrix (Note 3)

    Notes:

    1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
       convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
       JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
       among others:

              date1          date2

           2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
           2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
           2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
           2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)

       The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
       cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
       is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
       the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
       optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
       are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.

    2) The Celestial Intermediate Pole coordinates are the x,y components
       of the unit vector in the Geocentric Celestial Reference System.

    3) The matrix rc2i is the first stage in the transformation from
       celestial to terrestrial coordinates:

          [TRS] = RPOM * R_3(ERA) * rc2i * [CRS]

                = RC2T * [CRS]

       where [CRS] is a vector in the Geocentric Celestial Reference
       System and [TRS] is a vector in the International Terrestrial
       Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003), ERA is the Earth
       Rotation Angle and RPOM is the polar motion matrix.

    4) Although its name does not include "00", This function is in fact
       specific to the IAU 2000 models.

    Notes:

    1) The TT and UT1 dates tta+ttb and uta+utb are Julian Dates,
       apportioned in any convenient way between the arguments uta and
       utb.  For example, JD(UT1)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of

       The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
       cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
       acceptable.  The J2000 and MJD methods are good compromises
       between resolution and convenience.  In the case of uta,utb, the
       date & time method is best matched to the Earth rotation angle
       algorithm used:  maximum precision is delivered when the uta
       argument is for 0hrs UT1 on the day in question and the utb
       argument lies in the range 0 to 1, or vice versa.

    2) The arguments xp and yp are the coordinates (in radians) of the
       Celestial Intermediate Pole with respect to the International
       Terrestrial Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003),
       measured along the meridians to 0 and 90 deg west respectively.

    Notes:

    1) This function constructs the rotation matrix that transforms
       vectors in the celestial system into vectors in the terrestrial
       system.  It does so starting from precomputed components, namely
       the matrix which rotates from celestial coordinates to the
       intermediate frame, the Earth rotation angle and the polar motion
       matrix.  One use of the present function is when generating a
       series of celestial-to-terrestrial matrices where only the Earth
       Rotation Angle changes, avoiding the considerable overhead of
       recomputing the precession-nutation more often than necessary to
       achieve given accuracy objectives.

    2) The relationship between the arguments is as follows:

          [TRS] = RPOM * R_3(ERA) * rc2i * [CRS]

                = rc2t * [CRS]

    Notes:

    1) This function constructs the rotation matrix that transforms
       vectors in the celestial system into vectors in the terrestrial
       system.  It does so starting from precomputed components, namely
       the matrix which rotates from celestial coordinates to the
       true equator and equinox of date, the Greenwich Apparent Sidereal
       Time and the polar motion matrix.  One use of the present function
       is when generating a series of celestial-to-terrestrial matrices
       where only the Sidereal Time changes, avoiding the considerable
       overhead of recomputing the precession-nutation more often than
       necessary to achieve given accuracy objectives.

    2) The relationship between the arguments is as follows:

          [TRS] = rpom * R_3(gst) * rbpn * [CRS]

                = rc2t * [CRS]

       where [CRS] is a vector in the Geocentric Celestial Reference
       System and [TRS] is a vector in the International Terrestrial
       Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003).

    Form the celestial to terrestrial matrix given the date, the UT1,

    Returned:

    Notes:

    1) The TT and UT1 dates tta+ttb and uta+utb are Julian Dates,
       apportioned in any convenient way between the arguments uta and
       utb.  For example, JD(UT1)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of
       these ways, among others:

               uta            utb

           2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
           2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
           2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
           2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)

       The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
       cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
       acceptable.  The J2000 and MJD methods are good compromises
       between resolution and convenience.  In the case of uta,utb, the
       date & time method is best matched to the Earth rotation angle
       algorithm used:  maximum precision is delivered when the uta
       argument is for 0hrs UT1 on the day in question and the utb
       argument lies in the range 0 to 1, or vice versa.

    2) The caller is responsible for providing the nutation components;
       they are in longitude and obliquity, in radians and are with
       respect to the equinox and ecliptic of date.  For high-accuracy
       applications, free core nutation should be included as well as
       any other relevant corrections to the position of the CIP.

    3) The arguments xp and yp are the coordinates (in radians) of the
       Celestial Intermediate Pole with respect to the International
       Terrestrial Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003),
       measured along the meridians to 0 and 90 deg west respectively.

    4) The matrix rc2t transforms from celestial to terrestrial
       coordinates:

          [TRS] = RPOM * R_3(GST) * RBPN * [CRS]

                = rc2t * [CRS]

       where [CRS] is a vector in the Geocentric Celestial Reference
       System and [TRS] is a vector in the International Terrestrial
       Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003), RBPN is the
       bias-precession-nutation matrix, GST is the Greenwich (apparent)
       Sidereal Time and RPOM is the polar motion matrix.

    1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any

       JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,

    1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
       convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
       JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
       among others:

           2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)

       The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
       cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
       is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
       the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
       optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
       are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.

    2) The matrix operates in the sense V(true) = rmatn * V(mean), where
       the p-vector V(true) is with respect to the true equatorial triad
       of date and the p-vector V(mean) is with respect to the mean

    Returned:
       dpsi,deps     double   nutation, luni-solar + planetary (Note 2)

    Notes:

    1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
       convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
       JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,

              date1          date2

           2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)

           2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
           2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)

       The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
       cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
       is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
       the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
       optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
       are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.

    2) The nutation components in longitude and obliquity are in radians
       and with respect to the equinox and ecliptic of date.  The
       obliquity at J2000.0 is assumed to be the Lieske et al. (1977)
       value of 84381.448 arcsec.

       Both the luni-solar and planetary nutations are included.  The
       latter are due to direct planetary nutations and the
       perturbations of the lunar and terrestrial orbits.

    3) The function computes the MHB2000 nutation series with the
       associated corrections for planetary nutations.  It is an
       implementation of the nutation part of the IAU 2000A precession-
       nutation model, formally adopted by the IAU General Assembly in
       2000, namely MHB2000 (Mathews et al. 2002), but with the free
       core nutation (FCN - see Note 4) omitted.

    4) The full MHB2000 model also contains contributions to the
       nutations in longitude and obliquity due to the free-excitation
       of the free-core-nutation during the period 1979-2000.  These FCN
       terms, which are time-dependent and unpredictable, are NOT
       included in the present function and, if required, must be
       independently computed.  With the FCN corrections included, the
       present function delivers a pole which is at current epochs
       accurate to a few hundred microarcseconds.  The omission of FCN
       introduces further errors of about that size.

    5) The present function provides classical nutation.  The MHB2000
       algorithm, from which it is adapted, deals also with (i) the
       offsets between the GCRS and mean poles and (ii) the adjustments
       in longitude and obliquity due to the changed precession rates.
       These additional functions, namely frame bias and precession
       adjustments, are supported by the ERFA functions eraBi00  and
       eraPr00.

    6) The MHB2000 algorithm also provides "total" nutations, comprising
       the arithmetic sum of the frame bias, precession adjustments,
       luni-solar nutation and planetary nutation.  These total
       nutations can be used in combination with an existing IAU 1976
       precession implementation, such as eraPmat76,  to deliver GCRS-
       to-true predictions of sub-mas accuracy at current dates.
       However, there are three shortcomings in the MHB2000 model that
       must be taken into account if more accurate or definitive results
       are required (see Wallace 2002):

         (i) The MHB2000 total nutations are simply arithmetic sums,
             yet in reality the various components are successive Euler
             rotations.  This slight lack of rigor leads to cross terms
             that exceed 1 mas after a century.  The rigorous procedure
             is to form the GCRS-to-true rotation matrix by applying the
             bias, precession and nutation in that order.

        (ii) Although the precession adjustments are stated to be with
             respect to Lieske et al. (1977), the MHB2000 model does
             not specify which set of Euler angles are to be used and
             how the adjustments are to be applied.  The most literal
             and straightforward procedure is to adopt the 4-rotation
             epsilon_0, psi_A, omega_A, xi_A option, and to add DPSIPR
             to psi_A and DEPSPR to both omega_A and eps_A.

       (iii) The MHB2000 model predates the determination by Chapront
             et al. (2002) of a 14.6 mas displacement between the
             J2000.0 mean equinox and the origin of the ICRS frame.  It
             should, however, be noted that neglecting this displacement
             when calculating star coordinates does not lead to a
             14.6 mas change in right ascension, only a small second-
             order distortion in the pattern of the precession-nutation
             effect.

       For these reasons, the ERFA functions do not generate the "total
       nutations" directly, though they can of course easily be
       generated by calling eraBi00, eraPr00 and the present function
       and adding the results.

    7) The MHB2000 model contains 41 instances where the same frequency
       appears multiple times, of which 38 are duplicates and three are
       triplicates.  To keep the present code close to the original MHB
       algorithm, this small inefficiency has not been corrected.

           2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)

       The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
       cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
       is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
       the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
       optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
       are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.

    2) The nutation components in longitude and obliquity are in radians
       and with respect to the equinox and ecliptic of date.  The
       obliquity at J2000.0 is assumed to be the Lieske et al. (1977)
       value of 84381.448 arcsec.  (The errors that result from using
       this function with the IAU 2006 value of 84381.406 arcsec can be
       neglected.)

       The nutation model consists only of luni-solar terms, but
       includes also a fixed offset which compensates for certain long-
       period planetary terms (Note 7).

    3) This function is an implementation of the IAU 2000B abridged
       nutation model formally adopted by the IAU General Assembly in
       2000.  The function computes the MHB_2000_SHORT luni-solar
       nutation series (Luzum 2001), but without the associated
       corrections for the precession rate adjustments and the offset
       between the GCRS and J2000.0 mean poles.

    4) The full IAU 2000A (MHB2000) nutation model contains nearly 1400
       terms.  The IAU 2000B model (McCarthy & Luzum 2003) contains only
       77 terms, plus additional simplifications, yet still delivers
       results of 1 mas accuracy at present epochs.  This combination of
       accuracy and size makes the IAU 2000B abridged nutation model
       suitable for most practical applications.

       The function delivers a pole accurate to 1 mas from 1900 to 2100
       (usually better than 1 mas, very occasionally just outside
       1 mas).  The full IAU 2000A model, which is implemented in the
       function eraNut00a (q.v.), delivers considerably greater accuracy
       at current dates;  however, to realize this improved accuracy,
       corrections for the essentially unpredictable free-core-nutation
       (FCN) must also be included.

    5) The present function provides classical nutation.  The
       MHB_2000_SHORT algorithm, from which it is adapted, deals also
       with (i) the offsets between the GCRS and mean poles and (ii) the
       adjustments in longitude and obliquity due to the changed
       precession rates.  These additional functions, namely frame bias
       and precession adjustments, are supported by the ERFA functions
       eraBi00  and eraPr00.

    6) The MHB_2000_SHORT algorithm also provides "total" nutations,
       comprising the arithmetic sum of the frame bias, precession
       adjustments, and nutation (luni-solar + planetary).  These total
       nutations can be used in combination with an existing IAU 1976
       precession implementation, such as eraPmat76,  to deliver GCRS-
       to-true predictions of mas accuracy at current epochs.  However,
       for symmetry with the eraNut00a  function (q.v. for the reasons),
       the ERFA functions do not generate the "total nutations"
       directly.  Should they be required, they could of course easily
       be generated by calling eraBi00, eraPr00 and the present function
       and adding the results.

    7) The IAU 2000B model includes "planetary bias" terms that are
       fixed in size but compensate for long-period nutations.  The
       amplitudes quoted in McCarthy & Luzum (2003), namely
       Dpsi = -1.5835 mas and Depsilon = +1.6339 mas, are optimized for
       the "total nutations" method described in Note 6.  The Luzum
       (2001) values used in this ERFA implementation, namely -0.135 mas
       and +0.388 mas, are optimized for the "rigorous" method, where
       frame bias, precession and nutation are applied separately and in
       that order.  During the interval 1995-2050, the ERFA
       implementation delivers a maximum error of 1.001 mas (not
       including FCN).

       JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,

    3) The function first computes the IAU 2000A nutation, then applies
       adjustments for (i) the consequences of the change in obliquity
       from the IAU 1980 ecliptic to the IAU 2006 ecliptic and (ii) the
       secular variation in the Earth's dynamical form factor J2.

    4) The present function provides classical nutation, complementing
       the IAU 2000 frame bias and IAU 2006 precession.  It delivers a
       pole which is at current epochs accurate to a few tens of
       microarcseconds, apart from the free core nutation.

    Notes:

    1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
       convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
       JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
       among others:

              date1          date2

           2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
           2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
           2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
           2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)

       The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
       cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
       is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
       the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
       optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
       are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.

    2) This function returns the set of equinox based angles for the
       Capitaine et al. "P03" precession theory, adopted by the IAU in
       2006.  The angles are set out in Table 1 of Hilton et al. (2006):

       eps0   epsilon_0   obliquity at J2000.0
       psia   psi_A       luni-solar precession

       pia    pi_A        angle between moving and J2000.0 ecliptics
       bpia   Pi_A        longitude of ascending node of the ecliptic
       epsa   epsilon_A   obliquity of the ecliptic
       chia   chi_A       planetary precession
       za     z_A         equatorial precession: -3rd 323 Euler angle
       zetaa  zeta_A      equatorial precession: -1st 323 Euler angle
       thetaa theta_A     equatorial precession: 2nd 323 Euler angle
       pa     p_A         general precession
       gam    gamma_J2000 J2000.0 RA difference of ecliptic poles
       phi    phi_J2000   J2000.0 codeclination of ecliptic pole
       psi    psi_J2000   longitude difference of equator poles, J2000.0

       The returned values are all radians.

    3) Hilton et al. (2006) Table 1 also contains angles that depend on
       models distinct from the P03 precession theory itself, namely the
       IAU 2000A frame bias and nutation.  The quoted polynomials are
       used in other ERFA functions:

       . eraXy06  contains the polynomial parts of the X and Y series.

       . eraS06  contains the polynomial part of the s+XY/2 series.

       . eraPfw06  implements the series for the Fukushima-Williams
         angles that are with respect to the GCRS pole (i.e. the variants
         that include frame bias).

    4) The IAU resolution stipulated that the choice of parameterization
       was left to the user, and so an IAU compliant precession
       implementation can be constructed using various combinations of
       the angles returned by the present function.

    5) The parameterization used by ERFA is the version of the Fukushima-
       Williams angles that refers directly to the GCRS pole.  These
       angles may be calculated by calling the function eraPfw06.  ERFA
       also supports the direct computation of the CIP GCRS X,Y by
       series, available by calling eraXy06.

    6) The agreement between the different parameterizations is at the
       1 microarcsecond level in the present era.

    7) When constructing a precession formulation that refers to the GCRS
       pole rather than the dynamical pole, it may (depending on the
       choice of angles) be necessary to introduce the frame bias
       explicitly.

    8) It is permissible to re-use the same variable in the returned
       arguments.  The quantities are stored in the stated order.

    Notes:

    1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
       convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
       JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,

       The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in

       is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
       the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
       optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
       are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.

    2) The traditional accumulated precession angles zeta_A, z_A,
       theta_A cannot be obtained in the usual way, namely through
       polynomial expressions, because of the frame bias.  The latter
       means that two of the angles undergo rapid changes near this
       date.  They are instead the results of decomposing the
       precession-bias matrix obtained by using the Fukushima-Williams
       method, which does not suffer from the problem.  The
       decomposition returns values which can be used in the
       conventional formulation and which include frame bias.

    3) The three angles are returned in the conventional order, which
       is not the same as the order of the corresponding Euler
       rotations.  The precession-bias matrix is
       R_3(-z) x R_2(+theta) x R_3(-zeta).

    4) Should zeta_A, z_A, theta_A angles be required that do not
       contain frame bias, they are available by calling the ERFA
       function eraP06e.

       where the p-vector V(J2000) is with respect to the mean
       equatorial triad of epoch J2000.0 and the p-vector V(date)
       is with respect to the mean equatorial triad of the given
       date.

    3) Though the matrix method itself is rigorous, the precession
       angles are expressed through canonical polynomials which are
       valid only for a limited time span.  In addition, the IAU 1976
       precession rate is known to be imperfect.  The absolute accuracy
       of the present formulation is better than 0.1 arcsec from
       1960AD to 2040AD, better than 1 arcsec from 1640AD to 2360AD,
       and remains below 3 arcsec for the whole of the period
       500BC to 3000AD.  The errors exceed 10 arcsec outside the
       range 1200BC to 3900AD, exceed 100 arcsec outside 4200BC to
       5600AD and exceed 1000 arcsec outside 6800BC to 8200AD.

    Notes:

    1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
       convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
       JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
       among others:

       The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in

       applications, free core nutation should be included as well as

    Notes:

    1)  The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
        convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
        JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
        among others:

               date1          date2

            2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
            2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
            2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
            2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)

        The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
        cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
        is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
        the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
        optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
        are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.

    2)  The nutation components (luni-solar + planetary, IAU 2000A) in
        longitude and obliquity are in radians and with respect to the
        equinox and ecliptic of date.  Free core nutation is omitted;
        for the utmost accuracy, use the eraPn06 function, where the
        nutation components are caller-specified.

    3)  The mean obliquity is consistent with the IAU 2006 precession.

    4)  The matrix rb transforms vectors from GCRS to mean J2000.0 by
        applying frame bias.

    5)  The matrix rp transforms vectors from mean J2000.0 to mean of
        date by applying precession.

    6)  The matrix rbp transforms vectors from GCRS to mean of date by
        applying frame bias then precession.  It is the product rp x rb.

    7)  The matrix rn transforms vectors from mean of date to true of
        date by applying the nutation (luni-solar + planetary).

    8)  The matrix rbpn transforms vectors from GCRS to true of date
        (CIP/equinox).  It is the product rn x rbp, applying frame bias,
        precession and nutation in that order.

    9)  The X,Y,Z coordinates of the IAU 2006/2000A Celestial
        Intermediate Pole are elements (3,1-3) of the GCRS-to-true
        matrix, i.e. rbpn[2][0-2].

       measured along the meridians to 0 and 90 deg west respectively.

       positions the Terrestrial Intermediate Origin on the equator.  It
       is obtained from polar motion observations by numerical
       integration, and so is in essence unpredictable.  However, it is
       dominated by a secular drift of about 47 microarcseconds per
       century, and so can be taken into account by using s' = -47*t,
       where t is centuries since J2000.0.  The function eraSp00
       implements this approximation.

    Returned:
       dpsipr,depspr  double  precession corrections (Notes 2,3)

    Notes:

    1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
       convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
       JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
       among others:

              date1          date2

           2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
           2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
           2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
           2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)

       The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
       cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
       is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
       the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
       optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
       are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.

    2) The precession adjustments are expressed as "nutation
       components", corrections in longitude and obliquity with respect
       to the J2000.0 equinox and ecliptic.

    3) Although the precession adjustments are stated to be with respect
       to Lieske et al. (1977), the MHB2000 model does not specify which
       set of Euler angles are to be used and how the adjustments are to
       be applied.  The most literal and straightforward procedure is to
       adopt the 4-rotation epsilon_0, psi_A, omega_A, xi_A option, and
       to add dpsipr to psi_A and depspr to both omega_A and eps_A.

    4) This is an implementation of one aspect of the IAU 2000A nutation
       model, formally adopted by the IAU General Assembly in 2000,
       namely MHB2000 (Mathews et al. 2002).

    IAU 1976 precession model.

    This function forms the three Euler angles which implement general
    precession between two dates, using the IAU 1976 model (as for the
    FK5 catalog).

    Given:
       date01,date02   double    TDB starting date (Note 1)
       date11,date12   double    TDB ending date (Note 1)

       theta           double    2nd rotation: radians ccw around y

    Notes:

    1) The dates date01+date02 and date11+date12 are Julian Dates,
       apportioned in any convenient way between the arguments daten1
       and daten2.  For example, JD(TDB)=2450123.7 could be expressed in
       any of these ways, among others:

             daten1        daten2

           2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
           2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
           2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
           2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)

       The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in cases
       where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
       acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way the
       argument is handled internally and will deliver the optimum
       optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
       are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
       The two dates may be expressed using different methods, but at
       the risk of losing some resolution.

    2) The accumulated precession angles zeta, z, theta are expressed
       through canonical polynomials which are valid only for a limited
       time span.  In addition, the IAU 1976 precession rate is known to
       be imperfect.  The absolute accuracy of the present formulation
       is better than 0.1 arcsec from 1960AD to 2040AD, better than
       1 arcsec from 1640AD to 2360AD, and remains below 3 arcsec for
       the whole of the period 500BC to 3000AD.  The errors exceed
       10 arcsec outside the range 1200BC to 3900AD, exceed 100 arcsec
       outside 4200BC to 5600AD and exceed 1000 arcsec outside 6800BC to
       8200AD.

    3) The three angles are returned in the conventional order, which
       is not the same as the order of the corresponding Euler
       rotations.  The precession matrix is
       R_3(-z) x R_2(+theta) x R_3(-zeta).

    coordinates.  Compatible with IAU 2006/2000A precession-nutation.

    Given:
       date1,date2   double    TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
       x,y           double    CIP coordinates (Note 3)

    Returned (function value):
                     double    the CIO locator s in radians (Note 2)

    Notes:

    1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
       convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
       JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
       among others:

              date1          date2

           2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
           2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
           2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
           2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)

       The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
       cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
       is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
       the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
       optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
       are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.

    2) The CIO locator s is the difference between the right ascensions
       of the same point in two systems:  the two systems are the GCRS
       and the CIP,CIO, and the point is the ascending node of the
       CIP equator.  The quantity s remains below 0.1 arcsecond
       throughout 1900-2100.

    3) The series used to compute s is in fact for s+XY/2, where X and Y
       are the x and y components of the CIP unit vector;  this series
       is more compact than a direct series for s would be.  This
       function requires X,Y to be supplied by the caller, who is
       responsible for providing values that are consistent with the
       supplied date.

    4) The model is consistent with the "P03" precession (Capitaine et
       al. 2003), adopted by IAU 2006 Resolution 1, 2006, and the
       IAU 2000A nutation (with P03 adjustments).

       of frame bias, precession and nutation.

    3) The fundamental arguments used are as adopted in IERS Conventions
       (2003) and are from Simon et al. (1994) and Souchay et al.
       (1999).

    4) This is an alternative to the angles-based method, via the ERFA
       function eraFw2xy and as used in eraXys06a for example.  The two
       methods agree at the 1 microarcsecond level (at present), a
       negligible amount compared with the intrinsic accuracy of the
       models.  However, it would be unwise to mix the two methods
       (angles-based and series-based) in a single application.

    For a given TT date, compute the X,Y coordinates of the Celestial
    Intermediate Pole and the CIO locator s, using the IAU 2006
    precession and IAU 2000A nutation models.

    Given:

    Notes:

    1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
       convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
       JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
       among others:

              date1          date2

           2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)

           2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)

       The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
       cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
       is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
       the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
       optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
       are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.

    2) The Celestial Intermediate Pole coordinates are the x,y components
       of the unit vector in the Geocentric Celestial Reference System.

    3) The CIO locator s (in radians) positions the Celestial
       Intermediate Origin on the equator of the CIP.

    Notes:

    1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any

       JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,

              date1          date2

           2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)

       The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
       cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
       is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
       the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
       optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
       are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.

    2) The "complementary terms" are part of the equation of the
       equinoxes (EE), classically the difference between apparent and
       mean Sidereal Time:

          GAST = GMST + EE

       with:

          EE = dpsi * cos(eps)

       where dpsi is the nutation in longitude and eps is the obliquity
       of date.  However, if the rotation of the Earth were constant in
       an inertial frame the classical formulation would lead to
       apparent irregularities in the UT1 timescale traceable to side-
       effects of precession-nutation.  In order to eliminate these
       effects from UT1, "complementary terms" were introduced in 1994
       (IAU, 1994) and took effect from 1997 (Capitaine and Gontier,
       1993):

          GAST = GMST + CT + EE

       By convention, the complementary terms are included as part of
       the equation of the equinoxes rather than as part of the mean
       Sidereal Time.  This slightly compromises the "geometrical"
       interpretation of mean sidereal time but is otherwise
       inconsequential.

       The present function computes CT in the above expression,
       compatible with IAU 2000 resolutions (Capitaine et al., 2002, and
       IERS Conventions 2003).

    Notes:

    1) The date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
       convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
       JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
       among others:

              date1          date2

           2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
           2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
           2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
           2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)

       The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
       cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
       is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
       the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
       optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
       are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.

    2) The result, which is in radians, operates in the following sense:

    Notes:

    1) The UT1 date dj1+dj2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
       convenient way between the arguments dj1 and dj2.  For example,
       JD(UT1)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,

           2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)

       The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
       cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
       is acceptable.  The J2000 and MJD methods are good compromises
       between resolution and convenience.  The date & time method is
       best matched to the algorithm used:  maximum precision is
       delivered when the dj1 argument is for 0hrs UT1 on the day in
       question and the dj2 argument lies in the range 0 to 1, or vice
       versa.

    2) The algorithm is adapted from Expression 22 of Capitaine et al.
       2000.  The time argument has been expressed in days directly,
       and, to retain precision, integer contributions have been
       eliminated.  The same formulation is given in IERS Conventions

       0hrs UT1 on the day in question and the dj2 argument lies in the
       range 0 to 1, or vice versa.

    2) The algorithm is based on the IAU 1982 expression.  This is
       always described as giving the GMST at 0 hours UT1.  In fact, it
       gives the difference between the GMST and the UT, the steady
       4-minutes-per-day drawing-ahead of ST with respect to UT.  When
       whole days are ignored, the expression happens to equal the GMST
       at 0 hours UT1 each day.

    3) In this function, the entire UT1 (the sum of the two arguments
       dj1 and dj2) is used directly as the argument for the standard
       formula, the constant term of which is adjusted by 12 hours to
       take account of the noon phasing of Julian Date.  The UT1 is then
       added, but omitting whole days to conserve accuracy.

                  double    Greenwich apparent sidereal time (radians)

    Notes:

    1) The UT1 date uta+utb is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
       convenient way between the argument pair.  For example,
       JD=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways, among
       others:

               uta            utb

           2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
           2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
           2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
           2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)

       The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in cases
       where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
       acceptable.  The J2000 and MJD methods are good compromises
       between resolution and convenience.  For UT, the date & time
       method is best matched to the algorithm that is used by the Earth
       Rotation Angle function, called internally:  maximum precision is
       delivered when the uta argument is for 0hrs UT1 on the day in
       question and the utb argument lies in the range 0 to 1, or vice
       versa.

    2) The result is compatible with the IAU 2000 resolutions, except
       that accuracy has been compromised for the sake of speed and
       convenience in two respects:

       . UT is used instead of TDB (or TT) to compute the precession
         component of GMST and the equation of the equinoxes.  This
         results in errors of order 0.1 mas at present.

       . The IAU 2000B abridged nutation model (McCarthy & Luzum, 2001)
         is used, introducing errors of up to 1 mas.

    3) This GAST is compatible with the IAU 2000 resolutions and must be
       used only in conjunction with other IAU 2000 compatible
       components such as precession-nutation.

    4) The result is returned in the range 0 to 2pi.

    5) The algorithm is from Capitaine et al. (2003) and IERS
       Conventions 2003.

    Notes:

    1) The UT1 and TT dates uta+utb and tta+ttb respectively, are both
       Julian Dates, apportioned in any convenient way between the
       argument pairs.  For example, JD=2450123.7 could be expressed in
       any of these ways, among others:

           2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)

       The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
       cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
       is acceptable (in the case of UT;  the TT is not at all critical
       in this respect).  The J2000 and MJD methods are good compromises
       between resolution and convenience.  For UT, the date & time

    2) Both UT1 and TT are required, UT1 to predict the Earth rotation
       and TT to predict the effects of precession-nutation.  If UT1 is
       used for both purposes, errors of order 100 microarcseconds
       result.

    3) Although the function uses the IAU 2006 series for s+XY/2, it is
       otherwise independent of the precession-nutation model and can in
       practice be used with any equinox-based NPB matrix.

    Notes:

    1) The starting and ending TDB epochs ep1a+ep1b and ep2a+ep2b are
       Julian Dates, apportioned in any convenient way between the two
       parts (A and B).  For example, JD(TDB)=2450123.7 could be
       expressed in any of these ways, among others:

              epNa            epNb

           2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
           2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
           2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
           2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)

       The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in cases
       where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
       acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way the
       argument is handled internally and will deliver the optimum
       resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods are both
       good compromises between resolution and convenience.

    2) In accordance with normal star-catalog conventions, the object's
       right ascension and declination are freed from the effects of
       secular aberration.  The frame, which is aligned to the catalog
       equator and equinox, is Lorentzian and centered on the SSB.

       The proper motions are the rate of change of the right ascension
       and declination at the catalog epoch and are in radians per TDB
       Julian year.

       The parallax and radial velocity are in the same frame.

    3) Care is needed with units.  The star coordinates are in radians
       and the proper motions in radians per Julian year, but the
       parallax is in arcseconds.

    4) The RA proper motion is in terms of coordinate angle, not true
       angle.  If the catalog uses arcseconds for both RA and Dec proper
       motions, the RA proper motion will need to be divided by cos(Dec)
       before use.

    5) Straight-line motion at constant speed, in the inertial frame, is
       assumed.

    6) An extremely small (or zero or negative) parallax is overridden
       to ensure that the object is at a finite but very large distance,
       but not so large that the proper motion is equivalent to a large
       but safe speed (about 0.1c using the chosen constant).  A warning
       status of 1 is added to the status if this action has been taken.

    7) If the space velocity is a significant fraction of c (see the
       constant VMAX in the function eraStarpv), it is arbitrarily set
       to zero.  When this action occurs, 2 is added to the status.

    8) The relativistic adjustment carried out in the eraStarpv function
       involves an iterative calculation.  If the process fails to
       converge within a set number of iterations, 4 is added to the
       status.

    Returned (function value):
              int            status:
                                0 = OK
                               -1 = superluminal speed (Note 5)
                               -2 = null position vector

    Notes:

    1) The specified pv-vector is the coordinate direction (and its rate
       of change) for the date at which the light leaving the star
       reached the solar-system barycenter.

    2) The star data returned by this function are "observables" for an
       imaginary observer at the solar-system barycenter.  Proper motion
       and radial velocity are, strictly, in terms of barycentric
       coordinate time, TCB.  For most practical applications, it is
       permissible to neglect the distinction between TCB and ordinary
       "proper" time on Earth (TT/TAI).  The result will, as a rule, be
       limited by the intrinsic accuracy of the proper-motion and
       radial-velocity data;  moreover, the supplied pv-vector is likely
       to be merely an intermediate result (for example generated by the
       function eraStarpv), so that a change of time unit will cancel
       out overall.

       In accordance with normal star-catalog conventions, the object's
       right ascension and declination are freed from the effects of
       secular aberration.  The frame, which is aligned to the catalog
       equator and equinox, is Lorentzian and centered on the SSB.

       Summarizing, the specified pv-vector is for most stars almost
       identical to the result of applying the standard geometrical
       "space motion" transformation to the catalog data.  The
       differences, which are the subject of the Stumpff paper cited
       below, are:

       (i) In stars with significant radial velocity and proper motion,
       the constantly changing light-time distorts the apparent proper
       motion.  Note that this is a classical, not a relativistic,
       effect.

       (ii) The transformation complies with special relativity.

    3) Care is needed with units.  The star coordinates are in radians
       and the proper motions in radians per Julian year, but the
       parallax is in arcseconds; the radial velocity is in km/s, but
       the pv-vector result is in AU and AU/day.

    4) The proper motions are the rate of change of the right ascension
       and declination at the catalog epoch and are in radians per Julian
       year.  The RA proper motion is in terms of coordinate angle, not
       true angle, and will thus be numerically larger at high
       declinations.

    5) Straight-line motion at constant speed in the inertial frame is
       assumed.  If the speed is greater than or equal to the speed of
       light, the function aborts with an error status.

    6) The inverse transformation is performed by the function eraStarpv.

    Notes:

    1) The star data accepted by this function are "observables" for an
       imaginary observer at the solar-system barycenter.  Proper motion
       and radial velocity are, strictly, in terms of barycentric
       coordinate time, TCB.  For most practical applications, it is

       merely an intermediate result, so that a change of time unit
       would cancel out overall.

       In accordance with normal star-catalog conventions, the object's
       right ascension and declination are freed from the effects of
       secular aberration.  The frame, which is aligned to the catalog
       equator and equinox, is Lorentzian and centered on the SSB.

    2) The resulting position and velocity pv-vector is with respect to
       the same frame and, like the catalog coordinates, is freed from
       the effects of secular aberration.  Should the "coordinate
       direction", where the object was located at the catalog epoch, be
       required, it may be obtained by calculating the magnitude of the
       position vector pv[0][0-2] dividing by the speed of light in
       AU/day to give the light-time, and then multiplying the space
       velocity pv[1][0-2] by this light-time and adding the result to
       pv[0][0-2].

       Summarizing, the pv-vector returned is for most stars almost
       identical to the result of applying the standard geometrical
       "space motion" transformation.  The differences, which are the
       subject of the Stumpff paper referenced below, are:

       (i) In stars with significant radial velocity and proper motion,
       the constantly changing light-time distorts the apparent proper
       motion.  Note that this is a classical, not a relativistic,
       effect.

       (ii) The transformation complies with special relativity.

    3) Care is needed with units.  The star coordinates are in radians
       and the proper motions in radians per Julian year, but the
       parallax is in arcseconds; the radial velocity is in km/s, but
       the pv-vector result is in AU and AU/day.

    4) The RA proper motion is in terms of coordinate angle, not true
       angle.  If the catalog uses arcseconds for both RA and Dec proper
       motions, the RA proper motion will need to be divided by cos(Dec)
       before use.

    5) Straight-line motion at constant speed, in the inertial frame,
       is assumed.

    6) An extremely small (or zero or negative) parallax is interpreted
       to mean that the object is on the "celestial sphere", the radius
       of which is an arbitrary (large) value (see the constant PXMIN).
       When the distance is overridden in this way, the status,
       initially zero, has 1 added to it.

    7) If the space velocity is a significant fraction of c (see the
       constant VMAX), it is arbitrarily set to zero.  When this action
       occurs, 2 is added to the status.

    8) The relativistic adjustment involves an iterative calculation.
       If the process fails to converge within a set number (IMAX) of
       iterations, 4 is added to the status.

    9) The inverse transformation is performed by the function
       eraPvstar.

    Notes:

    1) This function converts a star position from the FK5 system to
       the Hipparcos system, in such a way that the Hipparcos proper
       motion is zero.  Because such a star has, in general, a non-zero
       proper motion in the FK5 system, the function requires the date
       at which the position in the FK5 system was determined.

    2) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
       convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
       JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
       among others:

              date1          date2

           2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
           2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
           2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
           2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)

       The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
       cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
       is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
       the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
       optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
       are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.

    3) The FK5 to Hipparcos transformation is modeled as a pure
       rotation and spin;  zonal errors in the FK5 catalogue are not

    2) The proper motions in RA are dRA/dt rather than
       cos(Dec)*dRA/dt, and are per year rather than per century.

       rotation and spin;  zonal errors in the FK5 catalog are not
       taken into account.

    Transform a Hipparcos star position into FK5 J2000.0, assuming
    zero Hipparcos proper motion.

    Given:

       dh            double    Hipparcos Dec (radians)

       dd5           double    Dec proper motion (rad/year, Note 4)

    Notes:

    1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
       convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
       JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
       among others:

              date1          date2

           2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
           2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
           2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
           2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)

       The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
       cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
       is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
       the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
       optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
       are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.

    2) The proper motion in RA is dRA/dt rather than cos(Dec)*dRA/dt.

    3) The FK5 to Hipparcos transformation is modeled as a pure rotation
       and spin;  zonal errors in the FK5 catalogue are not taken into
       account.

    4) It was the intention that Hipparcos should be a close
       approximation to an inertial frame, so that distant objects have
       zero proper motion;  such objects have (in general) non-zero
       proper motion in FK5, and this function returns those fictitious
       proper motions.

    5) The position returned by this function is in the FK5 J2000.0
       reference system but at date date1+date2.

                          else = binary logical OR of the above warnings

    Notes:

    1) The starting and ending TDB dates ep1a+ep1b and ep2a+ep2b are
       Julian Dates, apportioned in any convenient way between the two
       parts (A and B).  For example, JD(TDB)=2450123.7 could be
       expressed in any of these ways, among others:

               epna          epnb

           2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
           2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
           2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
           2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)

       The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
       cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
       is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
       the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
       optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
       are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.

    2) In accordance with normal star-catalog conventions, the object's
       right ascension and declination are freed from the effects of
       secular aberration.  The frame, which is aligned to the catalog
       equator and equinox, is Lorentzian and centered on the SSB.

       The proper motions are the rate of change of the right ascension
       and declination at the catalog epoch and are in radians per TDB
       Julian year.

       The parallax and radial velocity are in the same frame.

    3) Care is needed with units.  The star coordinates are in radians
       and the proper motions in radians per Julian year, but the
       parallax is in arcseconds.

    4) The RA proper motion is in terms of coordinate angle, not true
       angle.  If the catalog uses arcseconds for both RA and Dec proper
       motions, the RA proper motion will need to be divided by cos(Dec)
       before use.

    5) Straight-line motion at constant speed, in the inertial frame,
       is assumed.

    6) An extremely small (or zero or negative) parallax is interpreted
       to mean that the object is on the "celestial sphere", the radius
       of which is an arbitrary (large) value (see the eraStarpv
       function for the value used).  When the distance is overridden in
       this way, the status, initially zero, has 1 added to it.

    7) If the space velocity is a significant fraction of c (see the
       constant VMAX in the function eraStarpv), it is arbitrarily set
       to zero.  When this action occurs, 2 is added to the status.

    8) The relativistic adjustment carried out in the eraStarpv function
       involves an iterative calculation.  If the process fails to
       converge within a set number of iterations, 4 is added to the
       status.

    Transform geodetic coordinates to geocentric using the specified
    reference ellipsoid.

    Given:
       n       int        ellipsoid identifier (Note 1)
       elong   double     longitude (radians, east +ve)
       phi     double     latitude (geodetic, radians, Note 3)

    Returned:
       xyz     double[3]  geocentric vector (Note 2)

    Returned (function value):

                                  -2 = illegal case (Note 3)

    Notes:

    1) The identifier n is a number that specifies the choice of
       reference ellipsoid.  The following are supported:

          n    ellipsoid

          1     ERFA_WGS84
          2     ERFA_GRS80
          3     ERFA_WGS72

       The n value has no significance outside the ERFA software.  For
       convenience, symbols ERFA_WGS84 etc. are defined in erfam.h.

    2) The height (height, given) and the geocentric vector (xyz,
       returned) are in meters.

    3) No validation is performed on the arguments elong, phi and
       height.  An error status -1 means that the identifier n is
       illegal.  An error status -2 protects against cases that would
       lead to arithmetic exceptions.  In all error cases, xyz is set
       to zeros.

    4) The inverse transformation is performed in the function eraGc2gd.

       f       double     flattening (Notes 2,4)

    Notes:

    1) The equatorial radius, a, can be in any units, but meters is
       the conventional choice.

    2) The flattening, f, is (for the Earth) a value around 0.00335,
       i.e. around 1/298.

    3) The equatorial radius, a, and the height, height, must be
       given in the same units, and determine the units of the
       returned geocentric vector, xyz.

    4) No validation is performed on individual arguments.  The error
       status -1 protects against (unrealistic) cases that would lead
       to arithmetic exceptions.  If an error occurs, xyz is unchanged.

    5) The inverse transformation is performed in the function
       eraGc2gde.

    6) The transformation for a standard ellipsoid (such as ERFA_WGS84) can
       more conveniently be performed by calling eraGd2gc,  which uses a
       numerical code to identify the required a and f values.

    Position and velocity of a terrestrial observing station.

       phi     double       latitude (geodetic, radians, Note 1)

    Returned:
       pv      double[2][3] position/velocity vector (m, m/s, CIRS)

    Notes:

    1) The terrestrial coordinates are with respect to the ERFA_WGS84
       reference ellipsoid.

    2) xp and yp are the coordinates (in radians) of the Celestial
       Intermediate Pole with respect to the International Terrestrial
       Reference System (see IERS Conventions), measured along the
       meridians 0 and 90 deg west respectively.  sp is the TIO locator
       s', in radians, which positions the Terrestrial Intermediate
       Origin on the equator.  For many applications, xp, yp and
       (especially) sp can be set to zero.

    3) If theta is Greenwich apparent sidereal time instead of Earth
       rotation angle, the result is with respect to the true equator
       and equinox of date, i.e. with the x-axis at the equinox rather
       than the celestial intermediate origin.

    4) The velocity units are meters per UT1 second, not per SI second.
       This is unlikely to have any practical consequences in the modern
       era.

    5) No validation is performed on the arguments.  Error cases that
       could lead to arithmetic exceptions are trapped by the eraGd2gc
       function, and the result set to zeros.

                                 -1 = unacceptable date (Note 6)

    Notes:

    1) scale identifies the time scale.  Only the value "UTC" (in upper
       case) is significant, and enables handling of leap seconds (see
       Note 4).

    2) ndp is the number of decimal places in the seconds field, and can
       have negative as well as positive values, such as:

       ndp         resolution
       -4            1 00 00
       -3            0 10 00
       -2            0 01 00
       -1            0 00 10
        0            0 00 01
        1            0 00 00.1
        2            0 00 00.01
        3            0 00 00.001

       The limits are platform dependent, but a safe range is -5 to +9.

    3) d1+d2 is Julian Date, apportioned in any convenient way between
       the two arguments, for example where d1 is the Julian Day Number
       and d2 is the fraction of a day.  In the case of UTC, where the
       use of JD is problematical, special conventions apply:  see the
       next note.

    4) JD cannot unambiguously represent UTC during a leap second unless
       special measures are taken.  The ERFA internal convention is that
       the quasi-JD day represents UTC days whether the length is 86399,
       86400 or 86401 SI seconds.  In the 1960-1972 era there were
       smaller jumps (in either direction) each time the linear UTC(TAI)
       expression was changed, and these "mini-leaps" are also included
       in the ERFA convention.

    5) The warning status "dubious year" flags UTCs that predate the
       introduction of the time scale or that are too far in the future
       to be trusted.  See eraDat for further details.

                        -4 = bad fraction (Note 4)
                        -5 = internal error

    Notes:

    1) UTC began at 1960 January 1.0 (JD 2436934.5) and it is improper
       to call the function with an earlier date.  If this is attempted,
       zero is returned together with a warning status.

       Because leap seconds cannot, in principle, be predicted in
       advance, a reliable check for dates beyond the valid range is
       impossible.  To guard against gross errors, a year five or more
       after the release year of the present function (see the constant
       IYV) is considered dubious.  In this case a warning status is
       returned but the result is computed in the normal way.

       For both too-early and too-late years, the warning status is +1.
       This is distinct from the error status -1, which signifies a year
       so early that JD could not be computed.

    2) If the specified date is for a day which ends with a leap second,
       the UTC-TAI value returned is for the period leading up to the
       leap second.  If the date is for a day which begins as a leap
       second ends, the UTC-TAI returned is for the period following the
       leap second.

    3) The day number must be in the normal calendar range, for example
       1 through 30 for April.  The "almanac" convention of allowing
       such dates as January 0 and December 32 is not supported in this
       function, in order to avoid confusion near leap seconds.

    4) The fraction of day is used only for dates before the
       introduction of leap seconds, the first of which occurred at the
       end of 1971.  It is tested for validity (0 to 1 is the valid
       range) even if not used;  if invalid, zero is used and status -4
       is returned.  For many applications, setting fd to zero is
       acceptable;  the resulting error is always less than 3 ms (and
       occurs only pre-1972).

    5) The status value returned in the case where there are multiple
       errors refers to the first error detected.  For example, if the
       month and day are 13 and 32 respectively, status -2 (bad month)
       will be returned.  The "internal error" status refers to a
       case that is impossible but causes some compilers to issue a
       warning.

    6) In cases where a valid result is not available, zero is returned.

    Given:
       date1,date2   double  date, TDB (Notes 1-3)
       ut            double  universal time (UT1, fraction of one day)
       elong         double  longitude (east positive, radians)
       u             double  distance from Earth spin axis (km)
       v             double  distance north of equatorial plane (km)

    Returned (function value):
                     double  TDB-TT (seconds)

    Notes:

    1) The date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
       convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
       JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
       among others:

              date1          date2

           2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
           2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
           2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
           2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)

       The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
       cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
       is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
       the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
       optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
       are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.

       Although the date is, formally, barycentric dynamical time (TDB),
       the terrestrial dynamical time (TT) can be used with no practical
       effect on the accuracy of the prediction.

    2) TT can be regarded as a coordinate time that is realized as an
       offset of 32.184s from International Atomic Time, TAI.  TT is a
       specific linear transformation of geocentric coordinate time TCG,
       which is the time scale for the Geocentric Celestial Reference
       System, GCRS.

    3) TDB is a coordinate time, and is a specific linear transformation
       of barycentric coordinate time TCB, which is the time scale for
       the Barycentric Celestial Reference System, BCRS.

    4) The difference TCG-TCB depends on the masses and positions of the
       bodies of the solar system and the velocity of the Earth.  It is
       dominated by a rate difference, the residual being of a periodic
       character.  The latter, which is modeled by the present function,
       comprises a main (annual) sinusoidal term of amplitude
       approximately 0.00166 seconds, plus planetary terms up to about
       20 microseconds, and lunar and diurnal terms up to 2 microseconds.
       These effects come from the changing transverse Doppler effect
       and gravitational red-shift as the observer (on the Earth's
       surface) experiences variations in speed (with respect to the
       BCRS) and gravitational potential.

    5) TDB can be regarded as the same as TCB but with a rate adjustment
       to keep it close to TT, which is convenient for many applications.
       The history of successive attempts to define TDB is set out in
       Resolution 3 adopted by the IAU General Assembly in 2006, which
       defines a fixed TDB(TCB) transformation that is consistent with
       contemporary solar-system ephemerides.  Future ephemerides will
       imply slightly changed transformations between TCG and TCB, which
       could introduce a linear drift between TDB and TT;  however, any
       such drift is unlikely to exceed 1 nanosecond per century.

    6) The geocentric TDB-TT model used in the present function is that of
       Fairhead & Bretagnon (1990), in its full form.  It was originally
       supplied by Fairhead (private communications with P.T.Wallace,
       1990) as a Fortran subroutine.  The present C function contains an
       adaptation of the Fairhead code.  The numerical results are
       essentially unaffected by the changes, the differences with
       respect to the Fairhead & Bretagnon original being at the 1e-20 s
       level.

       The topocentric part of the model is from Moyer (1981) and
       Murray (1983), with fundamental arguments adapted from
       Simon et al. 1994.  It is an approximation to the expression
       ( v / c ) . ( r / c ), where v is the barycentric velocity of
       the Earth, r is the geocentric position of the observer and
       c is the speed of light.

       By supplying zeroes for u and v, the topocentric part of the
       model can be nullified, and the function will return the Fairhead
       & Bretagnon result alone.

    7) During the interval 1950-2050, the absolute accuracy is better
       than +/- 3 nanoseconds relative to time ephemerides obtained by
       direct numerical integrations based on the JPL DE405 solar system
       ephemeris.

    8) It must be stressed that the present function is merely a model,
       and that numerical integration of solar-system ephemerides is the
       definitive method for predicting the relationship between TCG and
       TCB and hence between TT and TDB.

    Notes:

    1) scale identifies the time scale.  Only the value "UTC" (in upper
       case) is significant, and enables handling of leap seconds (see
       Note 4).

    2) For calendar conventions and limitations, see eraCal2jd.

    3) The sum of the results, d1+d2, is Julian Date, where normally d1
       is the Julian Day Number and d2 is the fraction of a day.  In the
       case of UTC, where the use of JD is problematical, special
       conventions apply:  see the next note.

    4) JD cannot unambiguously represent UTC during a leap second unless
       special measures are taken.  The ERFA internal convention is that
       the quasi-JD day represents UTC days whether the length is 86399,
       86400 or 86401 SI seconds.  In the 1960-1972 era there were
       smaller jumps (in either direction) each time the linear UTC(TAI)
       expression was changed, and these "mini-leaps" are also included
       in the ERFA convention.

    5) The warning status "time is after end of day" usually means that
       the sec argument is greater than 60.0.  However, in a day ending
       in a leap second the limit changes to 61.0 (or 59.0 in the case
       of a negative leap second).

    6) The warning status "dubious year" flags UTCs that predate the
       introduction of the time scale or that are too far in the future
       to be trusted.  See eraDat for further details.

    7) Only in the case of continuous and regular time scales (TAI, TT,
       TCG, TCB and TDB) is the result d1+d2 a Julian Date, strictly
       speaking.  In the other cases (UT1 and UTC) the result must be
       used with circumspection;  in particular the difference between
       two such results cannot be interpreted as a precise time
       interval.

    2) The 2006 IAU General Assembly introduced a conventional linear
       transformation between TDB and TCB.  This transformation
       compensates for the drift between TCB and terrestrial time TT,
       and keeps TDB approximately centered on TT.  Because the
       relationship between TT and TCB depends on the adopted solar
       system ephemeris, the degree of alignment between TDB and TT over
       long intervals will vary according to which ephemeris is used.
       Former definitions of TDB attempted to avoid this problem by
       stipulating that TDB and TT should differ only by periodic
       effects.  This is a good description of the nature of the
       relationship but eluded precise mathematical formulation.  The
       conventional linear relationship adopted in 2006 sidestepped
       these difficulties whilst delivering a TDB that in practice was
       consistent with values before that date.

    3) TDB is essentially the same as Teph, the time argument for the
       JPL solar system ephemerides.

       Day Number and tdb2 is the fraction of a day.  The returned
       tcb1,tcb2 follow suit.

    2) The 2006 IAU General Assembly introduced a conventional linear
       transformation between TDB and TCB.  This transformation
       compensates for the drift between TCB and terrestrial time TT,
       and keeps TDB approximately centered on TT.  Because the
       relationship between TT and TCB depends on the adopted solar
       system ephemeris, the degree of alignment between TDB and TT over
       long intervals will vary according to which ephemeris is used.
       Former definitions of TDB attempted to avoid this problem by
       stipulating that TDB and TT should differ only by periodic
       effects.  This is a good description of the nature of the
       relationship but eluded precise mathematical formulation.  The
       conventional linear relationship adopted in 2006 sidestepped
       these difficulties whilst delivering a TDB that in practice was
       consistent with values before that date.

    3) TDB is essentially the same as Teph, the time argument for the
       JPL solar system ephemerides.

    Notes:

    1) utc1+utc2 is quasi Julian Date (see Note 2), apportioned in any
       convenient way between the two arguments, for example where utc1
       is the Julian Day Number and utc2 is the fraction of a day.

    2) JD cannot unambiguously represent UTC during a leap second unless
       special measures are taken.  The convention in the present
       function is that the JD day represents UTC days whether the
       length is 86399, 86400 or 86401 SI seconds.  In the 1960-1972 era
       there were smaller jumps (in either direction) each time the
       linear UTC(TAI) expression was changed, and these "mini-leaps"
       are also included in the ERFA convention.

    3) The warning status "dubious year" flags UTCs that predate the
       introduction of the time scale or that are too far in the future
       to be trusted.  See eraDat for further details.

    4) The function eraDtf2d converts from calendar date and time of day
       into 2-part Julian Date, and in the case of UTC implements the
       leap-second-ambiguity convention described above.

    5) The returned TAI1,TAI2 are such that their sum is the TAI Julian
       Date.
