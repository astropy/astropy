This package contains utilities to run the astropy test suite, tools
for writing tests, and general tests that are not associated with a
particular package.
"""

# NOTE: This is retained only for backwards compatibility. Affiliated packages
# should no longer import ``disable_internet`` from ``astropy.tests``. It is
# now available from ``pytest_remotedata``. However, this is not the
# recommended mechanism for controlling access to remote data in tests.
# Instead, packages should make use of decorators provided by the
# pytest_remotedata plugin: - ``@pytest.mark.remote_data`` for tests that
# require remote data access - ``@pytest.mark.internet_off`` for tests that
# should only run when remote data access is disabled.  Remote data access for
# the test suite is controlled by the ``--remote-data`` command line flag. This
# is either passed to ``pytest`` directly or to the ``setup.py test`` command.
#
# TODO: This import should eventually be removed once backwards compatibility
# is no longer supported.

try:
    # This should only be necessary during testing, in which case the test
    # package must be installed anyway.
