This is retained only for backwards compatibility. Affiliated packages
should no longer import ``disable_internet`` from ``astropy.tests``. It is
now available from ``pytest_remotedata``. However, this is not the
recommended mechanism for controlling access to remote data in tests.
Instead, packages should make use of decorators provided by the
pytest_remotedata plugin: - ``@pytest.mark.remote_data`` for tests that
require remote data access - ``@pytest.mark.internet_off`` for tests that
should only run when remote data access is disabled.  Remote data access for
the test suite is controlled by the ``--remote-data`` command line flag. This
is either passed to ``pytest`` directly or to the ``setup.py test`` command.

TODO: This module should eventually be removed once backwards compatibility
is no longer supported.
