.. note::

    The ecliptic coordinate systems (added in Astropy v1.1) have not been
    extensively tested for accuracy or consistency with other implementations of
    ecliptic coordinates.  We welcome contributions to add such testing, but in
    the meantime, users who depend on consistency with other implementations may
    wish to check test inputs against good datasets before using Astropy's
    ecliptic coordinates.
