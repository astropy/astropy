_base_ecliptic_docstring = """.. warning::
        In the current version of astropy, the ecliptic frames do not yet have
        stringent accuracy tests.  We recommend you test to "known-good" cases
        to ensure this frames are what you are looking for. (and then ideally
        you would contribute these tests to Astropy!)

    Parameters
    ----------
    representation : `BaseRepresentation` or None
        A representation object or None to have no data (or use the other keywords)

    lon : `Angle`, optional, must be keyword
        The ecliptic longitude for this object (``lat`` must also be given and
        ``representation`` must be None).
    lat : `Angle`, optional, must be keyword
        The ecliptic latitude for this object (``lon`` must also be given and
        ``representation`` must be None).
    distance : `~astropy.units.Quantity`, optional, must be keyword
        The distance for this object from the {0}.
        (``representation`` must be None).

    pm_lon_coslat : `Angle`, optional, must be keyword
        The proper motion in the ecliptic longitude (including the ``cos(lat)``
        factor) for this object (``pm_lat`` must also be given).
    pm_lat : `Angle`, optional, must be keyword
        The proper motion in the ecliptic latitude for this object
        (``pm_lon_coslat`` must also be given).
    distance : `~astropy.units.Quantity`, optional, must be keyword
        The distance for this object from the {0}.
        (``representation`` must be None).

    copy : bool, optional
        If `True` (default), make copies of the input coordinate arrays.
        Can only be passed in as a keyword argument.

    differential_cls : `BaseDifferential`, dict, optional
        A differential class or dictionary of differential classes (currently
        only a velocity differential with key 's' is supported). This sets
        the expected input differential class, thereby changing the expected
        keyword arguments of the data passed in. For example, passing
        ``differential_cls=CartesianDifferential`` will make the classes
        expect velocity data with the argument names ``v_x, v_y, v_z``.
