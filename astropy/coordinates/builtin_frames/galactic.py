class Galactic(BaseCoordinateFrame):
    """
    A coordinate or frame in the Galactic coordinate system.

    This frame is used in a variety of Galactic contexts because it has as its
    x-y plane the plane of the Milky Way.  The positive x direction (i.e., the
    l=0, b=0 direction) points to the center of the Milky Way and the z-axis
    points toward the North Galactic Pole (following the IAU's 1958 definition
    [1]_). However, unlike the `~astropy.coordinates.Galactocentric` frame, the
    *origin* of this frame in 3D space is the solar system barycenter, not
    the center of the Milky Way.

    Parameters
    ----------
    representation : `BaseRepresentation` or None
        A representation object or None to have no data (or use the other keywords)

    l : `Angle`, optional, must be keyword
        The Galactic longitude for this object (``b`` must also be given and
        ``representation`` must be None).
    b : `Angle`, optional, must be keyword
        The Galactic latitude for this object (``l`` must also be given and
        ``representation`` must be None).
    distance : `~astropy.units.Quantity`, optional, must be keyword
        The Distance for this object along the line-of-sight.

    pm_l_cosb : :class:`~astropy.units.Quantity`, optional, must be keyword
        The proper motion in Galactic longitude (including the ``cos(b)`` term)
        for this object (``pm_b`` must also be given).
    pm_b : :class:`~astropy.units.Quantity`, optional, must be keyword
        The proper motion in Galactic latitude for this object (``pm_l_cosb``
        must also be given).
    radial_velocity : :class:`~astropy.units.Quantity`, optional, must be keyword
        The radial velocity of this object.

    copy : bool, optional
        If `True` (default), make copies of the input coordinate arrays.
        Can only be passed in as a keyword argument.

    differential_cls : `BaseDifferential`, dict, optional
        A differential class or dictionary of differential classes (currently
        only a velocity differential with key 's' is supported). This sets
        the expected input differential class, thereby changing the expected
        keyword arguments of the data passed in. For example, passing
        ``differential_cls=CartesianDifferential`` will make the classes
        expect velocity data with the argument names ``v_x, v_y, v_z``.
