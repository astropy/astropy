    A coordinate or frame in the Galactic coordinate system.

    This frame is used in a variety of Galactic contexts because it has as its
    x-y plane the plane of the Milky Way.  The positive x direction (i.e., the
    l=0, b=0 direction) points to the center of the Milky Way and the z-axis
    points toward the North Galactic Pole (following the IAU's 1958 definition
