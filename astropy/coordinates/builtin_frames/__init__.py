"""
This package contains the coordinate frames implemented by astropy.

Users shouldn't use this module directly, but rather import from the
`astropy.coordinates` module.  While it is likely to exist for the long-term,
the existence of this package and details of its organization should be
considered an implementation detail, and is not guaranteed to hold for future
versions of astropy.

Notes
-----
The builtin frame classes are all imported automatically into this package's
namespace, so there's no need to access the sub-modules directly.

To implement a new frame in Astropy, a developer should add the frame as a new
module in this package.  Any "self" transformations (i.e., those that transform
from one frame to another frame of the same class) should be included in that
module.  Transformation functions connecting the new frame to other frames
should be in a separate module, which should be imported in this package's
``__init__.py`` to ensure the transformations are hooked up when this package is
imported.  Placing the transformation functions in separate modules avoids
circular dependencies, because they need references to the frame classes.
