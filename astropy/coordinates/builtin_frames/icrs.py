    A coordinate or frame in the ICRS system.

    If you're looking for "J2000" coordinates, and aren't sure if you want to
    use this or `~astropy.coordinates.FK5`, you probably want to use ICRS. It's
    more well-defined as a catalog coordinate and is an inertial system, and is
    very close (within tens of milliarcseconds) to J2000 equatorial.

    For more background on the ICRS and related coordinate transformations, see the
    references provided in the  :ref:`astropy-coordinates-seealso` section of the
    documentation.
