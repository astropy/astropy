    ----------------
    obstime : `~astropy.time.Time`
        The time at which the observation is taken.  Used for determining the
        position and orientation of the Earth.
    location : `~astropy.coordinates.EarthLocation`
        The location on the Earth.  This can be specified either as an
        `~astropy.coordinates.EarthLocation` object or as anything that can be
        transformed to an `~astropy.coordinates.ITRS` frame.
    pressure : `~astropy.units.Quantity`
        The atmospheric pressure as an `~astropy.units.Quantity` with pressure
        units.  This is necessary for performing refraction corrections.
        Setting this to 0 (the default) will disable refraction calculations
        when transforming to/from this frame.
    temperature : `~astropy.units.Quantity`
        The ground-level temperature as an `~astropy.units.Quantity` in
        deg C.  This is necessary for performing refraction corrections.
    relative_humidity`` : `~astropy.units.Quantity` or number.
        The relative humidity as a dimensionless quantity between 0 to 1.
        This is necessary for performing refraction corrections.
    obswl : `~astropy.units.Quantity`
        The average wavelength of observations as an `~astropy.units.Quantity`
         with length units.  This is necessary for performing refraction
         corrections.

    Notes
    -----
    The refraction model is based on that implemented in ERFA, which is fast
    but becomes inaccurate for altitudes below about 5 degrees.  Near and below
    altitudes of 0, it can even give meaningless answers, and in this case
    transforming to AltAz and back to another frame can give highly discrepant
    results.  For much better numerical stability, leaving the ``pressure`` at
    ``0`` (the default), disabling the refraction correction (yielding
    "topocentric" horizontal coordinates).
