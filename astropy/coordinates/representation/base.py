    Parameters
    ----------
    comp1, comp2, comp3 : `~astropy.units.Quantity` or subclass
        The components of the 3D points.  The names are the keys and the
        subclasses the values of the ``attr_classes`` attribute.
    differentials : dict, `~astropy.coordinates.BaseDifferential`, optional
        Any differential classes that should be associated with this
        representation. The input must either be a single `~astropy.coordinates.BaseDifferential`
        subclass instance, or a dictionary with keys set to a string
        representation of the SI unit with which the differential (derivative)
        is taken. For example, for a velocity differential on a positional
        representation, the key would be ``'s'`` for seconds, indicating that
        the derivative is a time derivative.
    copy : bool, optional
        If `True` (default), arrays will be copied. If `False`, arrays will
        be references, though possibly broadcast to ensure matching shapes.

    Notes
    -----
    All representation classes should subclass this base representation class,
    and define an ``attr_classes`` attribute, a `dict`
    which maps component names to the class that creates them. They must also
    define a ``to_cartesian`` method and a ``from_cartesian`` class method. By
    default, transformations are done via the cartesian system, but classes
    that want to define a smarter transformation path can overload the
    ``represent_as`` method. If one wants to use an associated differential
    class, one should also define ``unit_vectors`` and ``scale_factors``
    methods (see those methods for details).
