"""
This module contains a general framework for defining graphs of transformations
between coordinates, suitable for either spatial coordinates or more generalized
coordinate systems.

The fundamental idea is that each class is a node in the transformation graph,
and transitions from one node to another are defined as functions (or methods)
wrapped in transformation objects.

This module also includes more specific transformation classes for
celestial/spatial coordinate frames, generally focused around matrix-style
transformations that are typically how the algorithms are defined.

class FunctionTransformWithFiniteDifference(FunctionTransform):
    r"""
    A coordinate transformation that works like a `FunctionTransform`, but
    computes velocity shifts based on the finite-difference relative to one of
    the frame attributes.  Note that the transform function should *not* change
    the differential at all in this case, as any differentials will be
    overridden.

    When a differential is in the from coordinate, the finite difference
    calculation has two components. The first part is simple the existing
    differential, but re-orientation (using finite-difference techniques) to
    point in the direction the velocity vector has in the *new* frame. The
    second component is the "induced" velocity.  That is, the velocity
    intrinsic to the frame itself, estimated by shifting the frame using the
    ``finite_difference_frameattr_name`` frame attribute a small amount
    (``finite_difference_dt``) in time and re-calculating the position.

    Parameters
    ----------
    finite_difference_frameattr_name : str or None
        The name of the frame attribute on the frames to use for the finite
        difference.  Both the to and the from frame will be checked for this
        attribute, but only one needs to have it. If None, no velocity
        component induced from the frame itself will be included - only the
        re-orientation of any exsiting differential.
    finite_difference_dt : `~astropy.units.Quantity` or callable
        If a quantity, this is the size of the differential used to do the
        finite difference.  If a callable, should accept
        ``(fromcoord, toframe)`` and return the ``dt`` value.
    symmetric_finite_difference : bool
        If True, the finite difference is computed as
        :math:`\frac{x(t + \Delta t / 2) - x(t + \Delta t / 2)}{\Delta t}`, or
        if False, :math:`\frac{x(t + \Delta t) - x(t)}{\Delta t}`.  The latter
        case has slightly better performance (and more stable finite difference
        behavior).

    All other parameters are identical to the initializer for
    `FunctionTransform`.
