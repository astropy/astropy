Parameters
----------

translate_units : str, optional
    Specify which potentially unsafe translations of non-standard unit
    strings to perform.  By default, performs all.

    Although ``"S"`` is commonly used to represent seconds, its
    translation to ``"s"`` is potentially unsafe since the standard
    recognizes ``"S"`` formally as Siemens, however rarely that may be
    used.  The same applies to ``"H"`` for hours (Henry), and ``"D"``
    for days (Debye).

    This string controls what to do in such cases, and is
    case-insensitive.

    - If the string contains ``"s"``, translate ``"S"`` to ``"s"``.

    - If the string contains ``"h"``, translate ``"H"`` to ``"h"``.

    - If the string contains ``"d"``, translate ``"D"`` to ``"d"``.

    Thus ``''`` doesn't do any unsafe translations, whereas ``'shd'``

Returns `True` if ``CDi_ja`` is present.

``CDi_ja`` is an alternate specification of the linear transformation

Matrix elements in the IRAF convention are equivalent to the product
``CDi_ja = CDELTia * PCi_ja``, but the defaults differ from that of
the ``PCi_ja`` matrix.  If one or more ``CDi_ja`` keywords are present
then all unspecified ``CDi_ja`` default to zero.  If no ``CDi_ja`` (or

since this results in an interpretation of ``CDELTia`` consistent with
the original FITS specification.

While ``CDi_ja`` may not formally co-exist with ``PCi_ja``, it may

mix = """
mix(mixpix, mixcel, vspan, vstep, viter, world, pixcrd, origin)

Given either the celestial longitude or latitude plus an element of
the pixel coordinate, solves for the remaining elements by iterating
on the unknown celestial coordinate element using
`~astropy.wcs.Wcsprm.s2p`.

Parameters
----------
mixpix : int
    Which element on the pixel coordinate is given.

mixcel : int
    Which element of the celestial coordinate is given. If *mixcel* =
    ``1``, celestial longitude is given in ``world[self.lng]``,
    latitude returned in ``world[self.lat]``.  If *mixcel* = ``2``,
    celestial latitude is given in ``world[self.lat]``, longitude
    returned in ``world[self.lng]``.

vspan : (float, float)
    Solution interval for the celestial coordinate, in degrees.  The
    ordering of the two limits is irrelevant.  Longitude ranges may be
    specified with any convenient normalization, for example
    ``(-120,+120)`` is the same as ``(240,480)``, except that the
    solution will be returned with the same normalization, i.e. lie
    within the interval specified.

vstep : float
    Step size for solution search, in degrees.  If ``0``, a sensible,
    although perhaps non-optimal default will be used.

viter : int
    If a solution is not found then the step size will be halved and
    the search recommenced.  *viter* controls how many times the step
    size is halved.  The allowed range is 5 - 10.

world : ndarray
    World coordinate elements as ``double array[naxis]``.  ``world[self.lng]`` and
    ``world[self.lat]`` are the celestial longitude and latitude, in
    degrees.  Which is given and which returned depends on the value
    of *mixcel*.  All other elements are given.  The results will be
    written to this array in-place.

pixcrd : ndarray
    Pixel coordinates as ``double array[naxis]``.  The element indicated by *mixpix* is given and
    the remaining elements will be written in-place.

{}

Returns
-------
result : dict

    Returns a dictionary with the following keys:

    - *phi* (``double array[naxis]``)

    - *theta* (``double array[naxis]``)

        - Longitude and latitude in the native coordinate system of
          the projection, in degrees.

    - *imgcrd* (``double array[naxis]``)

        - Image coordinate elements.  ``imgcrd[self.lng]`` and
          ``imgcrd[self.lat]`` are the projected *x*- and
          *y*-coordinates, in decimal degrees.

    - *world* (``double array[naxis]``)

        - Another reference to the *world* argument passed in.

    Get the axes numbers for latitude and longitude

Notes
-----

Initially, the specified solution interval is checked to see if it's a
\"crossing\" interval.  If it isn't, a search is made for a crossing
solution by iterating on the unknown celestial coordinate starting at
the upper limit of the solution interval and decrementing by the
specified step size.  A crossing is indicated if the trial value of
the pixel coordinate steps through the value specified.  If a crossing
interval is found then the solution is determined by a modified form
of \"regula falsi\" division of the crossing interval.  If no crossing
interval was found within the specified solution interval then a
search is made for a \"non-crossing\" solution as may arise from a
point of tangency.  The process is complicated by having to make
allowance for the discontinuities that occur in all map projections.

Once one solution has been determined others may be found by
subsequent invocations of `~astropy.wcs.Wcsprm.mix` with suitably
restricted solution intervals.

Note the circumstance that arises when the solution point lies at a
native pole of a projection in which the pole is represented as a
finite curve, for example the zenithals and conics.  In such cases two
or more valid solutions may exist but `~astropy.wcs.Wcsprm.mix` only
ever returns one.

Because of its generality, `~astropy.wcs.Wcsprm.mix` is very
compute-intensive.  For compute-limited applications, more efficient
special-case solvers could be written for simple projections, for
example non-oblique cylindrical projections.

sub = """
sub(axes)

Extracts the coordinate description for a subimage from a
`~astropy.wcs.WCS` object.

The world coordinate system of the subimage must be separable in the
sense that the world coordinates at any point in the subimage must
depend only on the pixel coordinates of the axes extracted.  In
practice, this means that the ``PCi_ja`` matrix of the original image
must not contain non-zero off-diagonal terms that associate any of the
subimage axes with any of the non-subimage axes.

`sub` can also add axes to a wcsprm object.  The new axes will be
created using the defaults set by the Wcsprm constructor which produce
a simple, unnamed, linear axis with world coordinates equal to the
pixel coordinate.  These default values can be changed before
invoking `set`.

Parameters
----------
axes : int or a sequence.

    - If an int, include the first *N* axes in their original order.

    - If a sequence, may contain a combination of image axis numbers
      (1-relative) or special axis identifiers (see below).  Order is
      significant; ``axes[0]`` is the axis number of the input image
      that corresponds to the first axis in the subimage, etc.  Use an
      axis number of 0 to create a new axis using the defaults.

    - If ``0``, ``[]`` or ``None``, do a deep copy.

    Coordinate axes types may be specified using either strings or
    special integer constants.  The available types are:

    - ``'longitude'`` / ``WCSSUB_LONGITUDE``: Celestial longitude

    - ``'latitude'`` / ``WCSSUB_LATITUDE``: Celestial latitude

    - ``'cubeface'`` / ``WCSSUB_CUBEFACE``: Quadcube ``CUBEFACE`` axis

    - ``'spectral'`` / ``WCSSUB_SPECTRAL``: Spectral axis

    - ``'stokes'`` / ``WCSSUB_STOKES``: Stokes axis

    - ``'celestial'`` / ``WCSSUB_CELESTIAL``: An alias for the
      combination of ``'longitude'``, ``'latitude'`` and ``'cubeface'``.

Returns
-------
new_wcs : `~astropy.wcs.WCS` object

Raises
------
MemoryError
    Memory allocation failed.

InvalidSubimageSpecificationError
    Invalid subimage specification (no spectral axis).

NonseparableSubimageCoordinateSystemError
    Non-separable subimage coordinate system.

Notes
-----
Combinations of subimage axes of particular types may be extracted in
the same order as they occur in the input image by combining the
integer constants with the 'binary or' (``|``) operator.  For
example::

    wcs.sub([WCSSUB_LONGITUDE | WCSSUB_LATITUDE | WCSSUB_SPECTRAL])

would extract the longitude, latitude, and spectral axes in the same
order as the input image.  If one of each were present, the resulting
object would have three dimensions.

For convenience, ``WCSSUB_CELESTIAL`` is defined as the combination
``WCSSUB_LONGITUDE | WCSSUB_LATITUDE | WCSSUB_CUBEFACE``.

The codes may also be negated to extract all but the types specified,
for example::

    wcs.sub([
      WCSSUB_LONGITUDE,
      WCSSUB_LATITUDE,
      WCSSUB_CUBEFACE,
      -(WCSSUB_SPECTRAL | WCSSUB_STOKES)])

The last of these specifies all axis types other than spectral or
Stokes.  Extraction is done in the order specified by ``axes``, i.e. a
longitude axis (if present) would be extracted first (via ``axes[0]``)
and not subsequently (via ``axes[3]``).  Likewise for the latitude and
cubeface axes in this example.

The number of dimensions in the returned object may be less than or
greater than the length of ``axes``.  However, it will never exceed the
number of axes in the input image.

"""

to_header = """
to_header(relax=False)

`to_header` translates a WCS object into a FITS header.

The details of the header depends on context:

    - If the `~astropy.wcs.Wcsprm.colnum` member is non-zero then a
      binary table image array header will be produced.

    - Otherwise, if the `~astropy.wcs.Wcsprm.colax` member is set
      non-zero then a pixel list header will be produced.

    - Otherwise, a primary image or image extension header will be
      produced.

The output header will almost certainly differ from the input in a
number of respects:

    1. The output header only contains WCS-related keywords.  In
       particular, it does not contain syntactically-required keywords
       such as ``SIMPLE``, ``NAXIS``, ``BITPIX``, or ``END``.

    2. Deprecated (e.g. ``CROTAn``) or non-standard usage will be
       translated to standard (this is partially dependent on whether
       ``fix`` was applied).

    3. Quantities will be converted to the units used internally,
       basically SI with the addition of degrees.

    4. Floating-point quantities may be given to a different decimal
       precision.

    5. Elements of the ``PCi_j`` matrix will be written if and only if
       they differ from the unit matrix.  Thus, if the matrix is unity
       then no elements will be written.

    6. Additional keywords such as ``WCSAXES``, ``CUNITia``,
       ``LONPOLEa`` and ``LATPOLEa`` may appear.

    7. The original keycomments will be lost, although
       `~astropy.wcs.Wcsprm.to_header` tries hard to write meaningful
       comments.

    8. Keyword order may be changed.

Keywords can be translated between the image array, binary table, and
pixel lists forms by manipulating the `~astropy.wcs.Wcsprm.colnum` or
`~astropy.wcs.Wcsprm.colax` members of the `~astropy.wcs.WCS`
object.

Parameters
----------

relax : bool or int
    Degree of permissiveness:

    - `False`: Recognize only FITS keywords defined by the published
      WCS standard.

    - `True`: Admit all recognized informal extensions of the WCS
      standard.

    - `int`: a bit field selecting specific extensions to write.
      See :ref:`astropy:relaxwrite` for details.

ttype = """

"""

unitfix = """
unitfix(translate_units='')

Translates non-standard ``CUNITia`` keyvalues.

For example, ``DEG`` -> ``deg``, also stripping off unnecessary
whitespace.

Parameters
----------
translate_units : str, optional
    Do potentially unsafe translations of non-standard unit strings.

    Although ``\"S\"`` is commonly used to represent seconds, its
    recognizes ``\"S\"`` formally as Siemens, however rarely that may
    be translation to ``\"s\"`` is potentially unsafe since the
    standard used.  The same applies to ``\"H\"`` for hours (Henry),
    and ``\"D\"`` for days (Debye).

    This string controls what to do in such cases, and is
    case-insensitive.

    - If the string contains ``\"s\"``, translate ``\"S\"`` to ``\"s\"``.

    - If the string contains ``\"h\"``, translate ``\"H\"`` to ``\"h\"``.

    - If the string contains ``\"d\"``, translate ``\"D\"`` to ``\"d\"``.

    Thus ``''`` doesn't do any unsafe translations, whereas ``'shd'``
    does all of them.

Wcsprm = """
Wcsprm(header=None, key=' ', relax=False, naxis=2, keysel=0, colsel=None)

`~astropy.wcs.Wcsprm` performs the core WCS transformations.

.. note::
    The members of this object correspond roughly to the key/value
    pairs in the FITS header.  However, they are adjusted and
    normalized in a number of ways that make performing the WCS
    transformation easier.  Therefore, they can not be relied upon to
    get the original values in the header.  For that, use
    `astropy.io.fits.Header` directly.

The FITS header parsing enforces correct FITS "keyword = value" syntax
with regard to the equals sign occurring in columns 9 and 10.
However, it does recognize free-format character (NOST 100-2.0,
Sect. 5.2.1), integer (Sect. 5.2.3), and floating-point values
(Sect. 5.2.4) for all keywords.


.. warning::

    Many of the attributes of this class require additional processing when
    modifying underlying C structure.  When needed, this additional processing
    is implemented in attribute setters. Therefore, for mutable attributes, one
    should always set the attribute rather than a slice of its current value (or
    its individual elements) since the latter may lead the class instance to be
    in an invalid state.  For example, attribute ``crpix`` of a 2D WCS'
    ``Wcsprm`` object ``wcs`` should be set as ``wcs.crpix = [crpix1, crpix2]``
    instead of ``wcs.crpix[0] = crpix1; wcs.crpix[1] = crpix2]``.


Parameters
----------
header : `~astropy.io.fits.Header`, str, or None.
  If ``None``, the object will be initialized to default values.

key : str, optional
    The key referring to a particular WCS transform in the header.
    This may be either ``' '`` or ``'A'``-``'Z'`` and corresponds to
    the ``\"a\"`` part of ``\"CTYPEia\"``.  (*key* may only be
    provided if *header* is also provided.)

relax : bool or int, optional

    Degree of permissiveness:

    - `False`: Recognize only FITS keywords defined by the published
      WCS standard.

    - `True`: Admit all recognized informal extensions of the WCS
      standard.

    - `int`: a bit field selecting specific extensions to accept.  See
      :ref:`astropy:relaxread` for details.

naxis : int, optional
    The number of world coordinates axes for the object.  (*naxis* may
    only be provided if *header* is `None`.)

keysel : sequence of flag bits, optional
    Vector of flag bits that may be used to restrict the keyword types
    considered:

        - ``WCSHDR_IMGHEAD``: Image header keywords.

        - ``WCSHDR_BIMGARR``: Binary table image array.

        - ``WCSHDR_PIXLIST``: Pixel list keywords.

    If zero, there is no restriction.  If -1, the underlying wcslib
    function ``wcspih()`` is called, rather than ``wcstbh()``.

colsel : sequence of int
    A sequence of table column numbers used to restrict the keywords
    considered.  `None` indicates no restriction.
