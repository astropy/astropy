`astropy.wcs` contains utilities for managing World Coordinate System
(WCS) transformations in FITS files.  These transformations map the
pixel locations in an image to their real-world units, such as their
position on the sky sphere.

It performs three separate classes of WCS transformations:

- Core WCS, as defined in the `FITS WCS standard`_, based on Mark
  Calabretta's `wcslib`_.  See `~astropy.wcs.Wcsprm`.
- Simple Imaging Polynomial (`SIP`_) convention.  See
  `~astropy.wcs.Sip`.
- table lookup distortions as defined in WCS `distortion paper`_.  See
  `~astropy.wcs.DistortionLookupTable`.

Each of these transformations can be used independently or together in
a standard pipeline.
