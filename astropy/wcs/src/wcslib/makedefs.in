# GNU makefile definitions for building WCSLIB 4.10
#
# makedefs is generated from makedefs.in by configure.  It contains variable
# definitions and some general-purpose rules for building WCSLIB.
#
# Targets defined here
# --------------------
#   printenv:  Print the environment as seen within makefile rules.
#   show:      Print the values of all makefile variables used.
#
# Notes:
#   1) If you need to make changes then it may be preferable to modify
#      makedefs.in (not makedefs).  The makefile will detect this and
#      automatically re-run config.status to regenerate makedefs.
#
#   2) There are three choices for trigd functions - cosd(), sind(), tand(),
#      acosd(), asind(), atand(), and atan2d(), made by setting WCSTRIG:
#
#      1: Use the wrapper functions supplied with WCSLIB (default):
#         WCSTRIG := WRAPPER
#
#      2: Use native trigd functions supplied in a mathematics library such
#         as libsunmath (you will also need to add the library to the LIBS
#         variable below):
#         WCSTRIG := NATIVE
#
#      3: Use C preprocessor macro implementations of the trigd functions
#         (this method is typically 20% faster but may lead to rounding
#         errors near the poles):
#         WCSTRIG := MACRO
#
#   3) Variables for creating the shared (dynamic) library are currently
#      only set by 'configure' if the GNU C compiler is used.  However,
#      you can set these variables by hand, preferably in makedefs.in.
#
#      Shared libraries require position-independent code (PIC) which imposes
#      a performance overhead.  Consequently the static libraries are
#      compiled separately without this option.
#
#      The shared library will be installed with version number, e.g. as
#      libwcs.so.4.10 or libwcs.4.10.dylib with or without the symlink
#      required to make it visible to the linker (controlled by the SHRLN
#      variable).  On Macs it is deliberately not created because its very
#      existence precludes static linking with the cctools linker.  You can
#      still link dynamically by using -lwcs.4.10.
#
#   4) PGPLOT is Tim Pearson's Fortran graphics library with separate C
#      interface available from astro.caltech.edu.  It is only required by
#      one utility, wcsgrid, and the test programs that plot test grids
#      (tprj2, tcel1, tcel2, tspc, ttab2, ttab3, twcsmix, and tpih2).  You can
#      skip these by setting PGPLOTLIB to blank.
#
#      It is difficult for configure to deduce what auxiliary graphics
#      libraries may be needed for PGPLOT since it depends on which of many
#      possible graphics drivers were selected when PGPLOT was installed.
#      Therefore it is quite likely that you will need to add additional
#      libraries to PGPLOTLIB.
#
#   5) CFITSIO is Bill Pence's FITS I/O library written in C with Fortran
#      wrappers, available from http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio.
#
#      CFITSIO is required by three utilities, HPXcvt, wcsgrid, and wcsware,
#      and also by the test programs twcstab and twcshdr.  wcsware and the
#      test programs use fits_read_wcstab() which is implemented by
#      getwcstab.c.  However, this implementation is included in CFITSIO post
#      3.004beta, so getwcstab.c is required here only for older releases
#      (controlled by variable GETWCSTAB).  getwcstab.o itself is not inserted
#      into the WCSLIB object library.
#
#      If available, CFITSIO is also optionally used for test programs
#      tfitshdr, tbth1, tpih1 and tpih2 by setting preprocessor macro
#      -DDO_CFITSIO.
