          positional index for the corresponding class from
          `~astropy.wcs.wcsapi.BaseLowLevelWCS.world_axis_object_classes`.

        * The third argument is a string giving the name of the property

        `~astropy.wcs.wcsapi.BaseLowLevelWCS.world_axis_object_components`, and each value is a
        tuple with three elements or four elements:

        * The first element of the tuple must be a class or a string specifying
          the fully-qualified name of a class, which will specify the actual
          Python object to be created.

        * The second element, should be a tuple specifying the positional
          arguments required to initialize the class. If
          `~astropy.wcs.wcsapi.BaseLowLevelWCS.world_axis_object_components` specifies that the
          world coordinates should be passed as a positional argument, this this
          tuple should include `None` placeholders for the world coordinates.

        * The third tuple element must be a dictionary with the keyword
          arguments required to initialize the class.

        * Optionally, for advanced use cases, the fourth element (if present)
          should be a callable Python object that gets called instead of the
          class and gets passed the positional and keyword arguments. It should
          return an object of the type of the first element in the tuple.

        Note that we don't require the classes to be Astropy classes since there
        is no guarantee that Astropy will have all the classes to represent all
        kinds of world coordinates. Furthermore, we recommend that the output be
        kept as human-readable as possible.

        The classes used here should have the ability to do conversions by
        passing an instance as the first argument to the same class with
        different arguments (e.g. ``Time(Time(...), scale='tai')``). This is
        a requirement for the implementation of the high-level interface.

        The second and third tuple elements for each value of this dictionary
        can in turn contain either instances of classes, or if necessary can
        contain serialized versions that should take the same form as the main
        classes described above (a tuple with three elements with the fully
        qualified name of the class, then the positional arguments and the
        keyword arguments). For low-level API objects implemented in Python, we
        recommend simply returning the actual objects (not the serialized form)
        for optimal performance. Implementations should either always or never
        use serialized classes to represent Python objects, and should indicate
        which of these they follow using the
        `~astropy.wcs.wcsapi.BaseLowLevelWCS.serialized_classes` attribute.
