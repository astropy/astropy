## Reporting a Vulnerability

[GitHub private security vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)
should be enabled for `astropy`. But if that does not work for whatever reason, please report to `coordinators[at]astropy.org` (also see [Astropy Team listing](https://www.astropy.org/team)).

We will respond as soon as we are able. If vulnerability is accepted, we will work on a hotfix ASAP but that might still take a few weeks given the limited resources.
If a vulnerability is declined, we will take no further action as far as code is concerned. Either way, we will communicate back with you.

Thank you for your help!
